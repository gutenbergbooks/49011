
Transcriber’s notes:

In many sections of this book the spelling and punctuation are very
inconsistent because the text was originally written before English
spelling and punctuation became standardised. Such passages contain
numerous shorthand word contractions represented in the
original text by superscripted letters, diacritics, and archaic symbols
some of which cannot be accurately reproduced with current digital
media. In this plain text transcription, paired curly brackets are used
to indicate {characters} that were superscripted in the original text,
paired tildes denote text that was printed with a ~bold~ blackletter
font and paired underscores denote _italicised text_. Depending on
which font is being used, the diacritics and archaic symbols might or
might not display correctly.

PREFACE.


That the foundation of the Commerce, and consequently of the Greatness,
of London was laid by the old Livery Guilds--few will question. Much
is already known, through the Histories of such of them as have
been written--and an apology from me is not needed for a further
contribution to so interesting a study. But whilst I make no apology
for the contribution, I crave the indulgence of my readers for any
shortcomings which, from a literary point of view, may appear in this
work; I invite their attention to the matter, rather than to the style
in which it is expressed.

About eight years ago I applied to our Court for permission to search
the Records, and my request being complied with, I devoted such spare
time as I could secure from an engrossing occupation to the compilation
of these Annals. The work has necessarily led to the burning of much
midnight oil, because every extract and every line has been made _by
my own pen_. The researches have extended to the examination of all,
and the transcript of a considerable portion of thirteen lengthy
Charters and sets of By-laws, as also to the entire perusal of about
a hundred books of Records. In addition to this, there has been much
labour expended at the British Museum, the Public Record Office, the
Guildhall, and Somerset House.

The material thus collected became so voluminous, that I experienced
considerable difficulty in separating it into Subject Chapters, and
also in deciding what to retain and what to reject; my endeavour in
this respect having been to preserve all that is really interesting and
curious, discarding dry legal passages, doubtful points, and wearisome
repetitions.

None but those who have had experience of the crabbed eccentric writing
and contractions of former times (see some of the _fac-similes_ given)
and of the abbreviated “Court hand” Latin in which Charters and other
Records were penned, can have the least idea of the trouble and care
required in their deciphering; but in this respect I have not spared
pains in giving literal and accurate transcripts.

In no case have I modernized the old spelling, or interfered with the
quaintness of the original expressions; though all dates occurring
between the 1st January and 24th March prior to the year 1752 (when
“old style” was extinguished) have been rectified, and the “historical
year,” according to our present computation, given; thus rendering the
chronology systematic, and avoiding confusion and inaccuracy.

It is a matter of the greatest regret, that whilst we possess some
earlier records, our Court Minutes previous to 1551 are lost. It
is conjectured that they must have been at the Hall in 1793 (as a
partial list of Masters was then compiled), but all trace of them has
now disappeared. Again, the Minutes from 1651-1689 are now missing,
although they were at the Hall about forty years ago.

I may here take the opportunity to remark that the Barbers and
Barber-Surgeons held a somewhat distinctive position apart from other
Companies, inasmuch as they were a Professional rather than a Trade
Guild, and their History, consequently, becomes invested with an
especial interest. Another point to which I, as a Barber, am proud
to refer is that our Company stood out, alone, as the pioneer of
Technical Education, hundreds of years before it became as popular
as it now is. From the middle of the fifteenth century the Company
was careful to provide for Surgical Lectures, and the regular and
systematic instruction of its members. The means originally employed
may have been primitive, but they were dictated by high motives, and
gradually extended and developed; a Museum (a poor one, it is true)
and a valuable Library were founded, an Anatomical Theatre was built,
and every opportunity taken to encourage the Scientific study of
Surgery--all with results fraught with the greatest benefit, not only
to London, but to the Kingdom at large.

In conclusion, I desire to express my thanks to those who have aided
me in my work, and especially to my dear and valued friend, Past
Master Charles John Shoppee, whose practical assistance, advice and
encouragement all through, have been to me of the greatest service. Mr.
D’Arcy Power, M.A., has laid me under much obligation, and particularly
for revising and perfecting my translation of the Norman-French
Ordinances, 12th Rich. II. My son, Austin Travers Young, has rendered
valuable assistance in delineating the several Illustrations throughout
the work, and lastly, I must record, with gratitude, my obligation to
Mr. Edward Lawless for the attention and care bestowed upon me on the
numerous occasions of my visits to the Hall.

The preparation of this work, a somewhat arduous task for an Amateur,
has been to me purely a labour of love, and, in laying down my pen I
may be permitted to add, that my best wishes for the Ancient Mystery of
Barbers are summed up in the words of our time-honoured toast, “_The
Worshipful Company of Barbers, Root and Branch, and may it flourish for
ever_.”

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT


THE BARBERS UNINCORPORATE.

The origin of the Barbers’ Guild partook of a religious character; and
the meeting together of men of the craft for religious observances, for
attending the funerals and obits of deceased members and their wives,
and for feasting once a year, gradually transformed a semi-social and
religious guild into what ultimately became a purely secular or “trade
guild.” This religious origin is borne out by the very important Return
made by the Barbers of London, to the Writ of 12th Rich. II, and is
strengthened by reference to the Returns made by the Barbers of Lincoln
and of Norwich (both which latter are preserved at the Record Office),
and which clearly point to those guilds being of a religious character;
indeed the Barbers of Norwich do not seem to have had a single secular
or trade ordinance in their constitution.

1388. In the Return of the Barbers of London to the Writ of Richard
II, the Masters recite that they “have found a document amongst the
articles of their records made of the time to which memory runneth
not,” concerning the points upon which the fraternity was founded;

  PRIMEREMENT al honourance de Dieu et touz ses Seyntes et pur
  excitac͠on les c͠oens des gentz a bien faire et perseverance avoir et
  bien faitz. . . . .

  FIRSTLY to the honour of God and all his Saints, and to stir up the
  commons of the people to do well, and to have perseverance in well
  doing. . . . .

Regulations were made enjoining charity, attendance at funerals and
obits, against the enticing away of the servants of others, providing
for the amicable settlement of disputes, and the like.

The articles above briefly referred to, contain nothing in particular
as to trade regulation or inspection, leaving a pretty certain
inference that they were made for the governance of a social and
religious guild or fraternity. We shall presently see that in 1308, the
Company partook of the nature of a trade guild, and we may therefore
reasonably presume that the articles made in the time to which memory
in 1388 did not run, were drawn up _previous_ to 1308, and therefore
without much hesitation we may assign the origin of the Barbers’
Company to at least the xiij{th.} century.

In the early part of the reign of Edward II, and indeed for a long
while previously, the Barbers were practitioners in the art of Surgery;
at all events they performed the minor operations of that craft, such
as bleeding, tooth-drawing, cauterization, and the like.

The Barbers having been accustomed to assist the monks in the surgical
operations performed by them in early times, acquired a degree of
proficiency which enabled them to practise as Surgeons themselves. Up
till about the xij{th.} century the practice of Surgery and Medicine
was however almost wholly confined to the Clergy, who seem to have
enjoyed the double privilege of curing men’s bodies as well as their
souls. In 1163 the Council of Tours, under Pope Alexander III,
considering that a practice which involved in its operations the
shedding of blood, was incompatible with the holy office of the clergy,
forbad them to interfere in any matter of Surgery; the consequence
of this edict was that they gave over the operations of Surgery but
continued to practise the healing art of Medicine.

As already said, the Clergy very frequently employed the Barbers
as their assistants, and committed to them the preparation of
the medicated baths and the performance of sundry minor surgical
operations. No doubt the Edict of Tours was hailed with joy by the
Barbers, who thus found a lucrative practice thrown in their way,
and seized the opportunity of practising as Surgeons “on their own
account,” calling themselves Barber-Surgeons, and practising both
Barbery and Surgery.

_c._ 1307. The archives preserved at the Guildhall have many entries
concerning the Barbers’ Company, and in _Letter-Book D._ 157{B.}
there is an ordinance concerning the Barbers of London, which shows
that at this time they were occupied in Surgery, and advertised
their profession in an objectionable manner, which was very properly
forbidden by the City authorities.

  DE BARBOURS. Et que nul barbier ne soit se ose ne si hardy qil mette
  sank en leur fenestres en apiert ou en view des gentz, mais pryvement
  le facent porter a Thamise sur peine des doux souldz rendre al oeps
  des Viscountz.

  CONCERNING BARBERS. And that no barbers shall be so bold or so hardy
  as to put blood in their windows, openly or in view of folks, but let
  them have it privily carried unto the Thames, under pain of paying
  two shillings to the use of the Sheriffs.

1308. The first express entry which we have concerning our Company is
the presentation and admission of Richard le Barber, as Supervisor
or Master of the Barbers, before the Court of Aldermen in 1308
(_Letter-Book C._ 96).

  RIC’S LE BARBOUR ex oppõito ecc̃lie omñi scoꝜ parue elect’ est et
  p’sentatˀ pˀ Barbitonsores london die Martˀ p’xˀ p’t fm̃ Sc̃e Lucie
  virgĩs Anno R. E. fiɫ R. E. sc̃do coram dñis Nichõ de ffarndon tũc
  maiore london Johñe de Wengũue cetˀisqʒ Aldermĩs ad custodiendˀ
  officiũ BarbitonsoꝜ &c. Et admissus est et jurˀ q’d quolibet mense
  faciet scrutiniũ pˀ totñ officiũ suũ et si quos invenˀit lupanarˀ
  id alio mõ inhonestos et in scandalũ officii &c. eos distringat &
  distriaõem in cam’am apportari faciet &c.

  RICHARD LE BARBOUR dwelling opposite to the Church of Allhallows the
  Less, was chosen and presented by the Barbers of London, on Tuesday
  next after the feast of Saint Lucy the Virgin (_13th December_) in
  the second year of the reign of King Edward, son of King Edward,
  before Sir Nicholas de Farndon, then Mayor of London, John de
  Wengrave and other Aldermen, to have supervision over the trade of
  the Barbers &c. And he was admitted and made oath that every month
  he would make scrutiny throughout the whole of his trade, and if he
  should find any among them keeping brothels, or acting unseemly in
  any other way, and to the scandal of the trade, he was to distrain
  upon them, and cause the distress to be taken into the Chamber (_of
  London_) &c.

The foregoing record does not appear very creditable to the reputation
of the Barbers of Edward the Second’s time, but it should be remembered
that in those days, and for a long period before and afterwards, the
Barbers superintended the Baths (Bagnios) and that these places were
not infrequently the resort of improper characters; a few of our
predecessors had perhaps, under the circumstances, been somewhat lax in
their morality, and let us hope that Richard le Barber administered to
those whom he found offending, due correction according to his oath and
their deserts.

It would not seem from the terms of the admission, that the Master was
at that period elected annually, and the Office was probably held by
one man for a considerable number of years. There is no entry in the
City books (which have been carefully examined for the purpose) of
another admission to the Office until the year 1376, when two Masters
were appointed, and then for some years subsequently two new Masters
were sworn in annually.

1309. In this year we find the first record of an admission of a Barber
to the freedom of the City, and several others occur about this period
(_see_ Freemen).

1310. On Wednesday next after the feast of the Nativity, 4th Edward II,
Gerard the Barber was sworn keeper of the Gate of Newgate (_Letter-Book
D._ 113), and there are other entries of Barbers being appointed
keepers or porters at the City gates; from one of these, in 1375, it
would seem that they were to keep a strict watch that no lepers should
enter the city, and it was doubtless on account of their surgical
knowledge enabling them to distinguish those afflicted with leprosy,
that these offices were conferred upon them.

1310. On Monday before the feast of St. Gregory the will of Richard
le Barber, our first Master, was proved in the Court of Husting. To
Katherine his wife and Johanna his daughter, he left tenements and
rents in Bread Street, Cordwainer Street, Queenhithe, Candlewike
Street, and Whitecrouche Street. To Thomas de Mangrave his apprentice,
a shop in Bread Street; to the fabric of London Bridge 20{s.,} and the
residue to pious uses.

1312. The earliest admission of a Surgeon (_not_ a Barber Surgeon) to
the freedom is that of “Magister Johẽs de Suthwerk cirurgicus,” who was
sworn on Friday before the feast of St. Barnabas, 5th Edward II, and
who paid nothing for his freedom, being admitted at the instance of
Hugh de Waltham, Town Clerk.

Among the Archives at Guildhall are various entries relating to early
Barbers, which, although not touching upon the history of our Company,
may properly be preserved in these pages, and I shall therefore give
translations of a few of them.

  1315. On Monday next after the feast of the Purification of the
  Blessed Virgin Mary, in the 8th Edward II, by common assent of the
  Mayor and Aldermen in the Hustings of pleas of Land, there was
  granted and demised to William de Dounesheued, Barber to Sir John de
  Sandale, Chancellor of our Lord the King, a certain house belonging
  to the Bridge of London, to have and to hold to the said William for
  his whole life, he paying yearly on the usual days two and a half
  marks to the keepers for the time being of the said Bridge, which
  said house is situate between a house belonging to the said Bridge in
  which John Mew now dwells towards the West, and a house belonging to
  Thomas le Maderman towards the East, in the Parish of Saint Dionis
  Backchurch London. And the said William, the said house and its
  appurtenances in all needful manner shall sustain, and against wind
  and rain cause the same to be defended during the whole term of his
  life.

And there was a proviso that if the rent should remain unpaid for a
whole year that the Bridge Keepers should re-enter. (_Letter-Book E._
28{B.})

1319. On Thursday after the feast of St. Valentine, 13th Edward II,
there was enrolled an obligation by which Roger the Barber (servant to
John de Dallinge, Sheriff of London) and Margaret his wife, were bound
to pay £100 to Sir John de Laugecombe, Rector of the Church of Laumaz
Heys (_sic_) before the feast of Easter. (_Letter-Book E._ 85.)

1320. On Wednesday next after the feast of Saints Fabian and Sebastian,
13th Edward II, Lawrence the Barber, one of the men sworn to keep the
Poultry Market on Cornhill, laid an information against John Bakon that
he the said John was a forestaller of the Market. (_Letter-Book E._
96{B.})

1320. In the same year among the names of the Citizens assessed to
contribute to a fine of £1,000 to the King, occurs that of Thomas the
Barber. (_Letter-Book E._ 106{B.})

1320. On Monday next before the feast of St. Margaret the Virgin, 14th
Edward II, the Wardship of Alice, Joane and Agnes, children of John de
Wynton, Barber, deceased, was given to Joane his widow; several shops
and houses in the City belonging to the deceased are scheduled as for
the benefit of the Wards, and Robert de Lamyngton, John de Bristolle,
Barber, and Roger de Croidon were bound as sureties. (_Letter-Book E._
114.)

Instances also occur of City Wards (sons of Barbers deceased) being
apprenticed by the Chamberlain to various trades.

1340. In 14th Edward III, Hamo the Barber was assessed by the City
at £10 as his contribution towards a forced loan of £5,000 to the
King (_Letter-Book F._ 33) and six years later (1346) Hamo was again
assessed at 20_s._ towards a “present” of 3,000 marks to the King.

1370. On 14th March, 44th Edward III, the wardship of Alice (aged 3
years), daughter of Nicholas the Barber, was given to Gilbert Prince,
who was to use her legacy of 40 marks for her benefit.

1374. On the 28th July, 1374, Lawrence de Weston, Barber (Master of
the Company in 1376), and Margaret his wife, mother of the said Alice,
came before the Mayor, &c., and proved that the said Alice was dead,
whereupon Gilbert Prince, the Executor of Nicholas the Barber’s will,
was discharged, and the money paid to Lawrence and Margaret de Weston.
(_Letter-Book G._ 244 and 317{B.})

Reverting now from individuals to the Company, we find that the Barbers
existed as a Trade Guild, but unincorporated certainly from the year
1308, and that they were at first ruled by one Master, and later on
(in 1376) by two Masters, appointed annually. This Company of Barbers
was composed of two classes of Members--viz., those who practised
Barbery proper (perhaps including phlebotomy and tooth drawing), and
those who practised Surgery, and who were, for distinction sake, called
Barber-Surgeons (in the City books they are spoken of as “Barbers
exercising the faculty of Surgery”). For aught we know to the contrary,
a perfect harmony and good understanding existed between these two
sections of the Company, and it is probable that the ranks of the
latter were continually recruited from the former.

1381. The earliest evidence of the existence of our Hall is to be found
in Harl. MS. 541, which contains a list of Companies’ Halls in the
City, temp. 5 Richard II, by which it appears that the Barbers’ Hall
was then, as now, in the Parish of Saint Olave, Silver Street, and
doubtless on the same site; the entry is, “Barbar hall y{e} p’yssh of
Seynt Oluf in Sylverstrete.” In 1490 the Hall is _known_ to have been
on the same site.

1388. In this year Richard II sent his writs all over the Kingdom to
enquire into the nature and constitution of the several guilds and
fraternities, religions, social or craft, and the returns to these
writs, which must have been an immense number, were formerly kept among
the Records at the Tower of London. Herbert, in his History of the
Livery Companies, refers to his fruitless endeavours to discover these
returns, and I have made diligent enquiry at the Record Office for
them also, with the undoubted result that all of those which relate to
the London Trading Guilds are lost. There are, however, a great number
relating to London religious guilds and to trade guilds all over the
country. Two of these concerning the Barbers of Norwich and of Lincoln
are so highly interesting that I have preserved them in Appendix A.

Amongst our Archives at Barbers’ Hall, is a vellum book of Ordinances
written out fair in 1658, and therein is to be found a copy of the
return made by the Barbers of London to the writ of Richard II, and
which the Company caused to be extracted from the Tower Records in
1634. It is certified by William Colet as agreeing with the original,
but unfortunately Mr. Colet (although he was Deputy-Keeper of the
Records) or his copyist has made one or two mistakes, which necessitate
a little hiatus in the translation, and he has put the year as the 11th
instead of the 12th of Richard II. That the latter year is the correct
one is abundantly proved by the dates on the original writs and on the
numerous returns still in existence at the Record Office, as also by
the names of the Masters certifying, who are recorded at Guildhall as
having been admitted 10th September, 12th Richard II.

Richard II was more solicitous as to the funds and property of the
Guilds, than he was about their observances, and our predecessors seem
to have quickly acquainted him with their pecuniary position, “the
which Company have neither tenements nor rents to their common use.”

The Masters recite an old document which they found in their strong
box, and which will well repay perusal; it opens with a devout
dedication to the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and the glorious company of
heaven, and the first Ordinance being expressly made in honour of God
and all saints, and with the intention of stirring up the people to do
well and to persevere therein, we must all approve of it. It provides
firstly, that decayed brethren shall have an allowance of 10-1/2_d._
per week, if their poverty have not come about by their own folly.
The second and third Ordinances relate to attendance at funerals and
obits of deceased members. Then follow certain rules, that no man shall
entice away another’s servant; the Masters to settle disputes, payment
of quarterage, refusal of office, absence from Mass and the yearly
feast, the livery clothing, &c., &c. It is well to observe here the
evidence of the antiquity of our livery, of the quarterage, and of the
feast, all of which have come down to these days.

Some later Ordinances are added, which were apparently made in 1387.
This return is probably the only one extant of the whole of those made
by the London trade guilds, and is therefore of the highest interest.
A copy of the original (which is in Norman French), together with a
translation, follows.

  JOHN HEYDON and Henry Cook, Masters, William Chapman and William
  Gomine, Surveyors of the Company called the Fraternity of Barbers
  of the City of London of ancient time established, certifying
  to the Council of Our Lord the King, in his Chancery, the form
  manner and condition of all the articles, customs and their
  circumstances contained in the Records of the same Company in the
  form following:--The which Company have neither tenements nor rents
  to their common use, And these articles the said Company have not
  used in their time excepting only for to have their Livery once a
  year, and to pay their quarterage to maintain the poor folk of the
  same Company, and once a year to assemble to feast, and to elect new
  Masters and Surveyors without any other article of their writing to
  put forward except those which only are made to the honour of God;
  but, however, as they have found a document amongst the articles of
  the Records, made of the time to which memory runneth not, they have
  presented it to your most wise discretions.

  THIS INDENTURE made in the name of the Omnipotent God, the Father
  and Son and the Holy Ghost, and of our Lady Saint Mary and of all
  the glorious Company of Heaven, concerning the foundation of the
  Government of the Fraternity of Barbers of the City of London
  Witnesseth how and upon what points the said Fraternity is founded
  and ordained.

  FIRSTLY to the honour of God and all his Saints, and to stir up the
  Commons of the people to do well, and to have perseverance in well
  doing, it is ordained that if any brother of this Fraternity who has
  been of this Fraternity for seven years by chance fall into trouble
  or into poverty, and if he have nothing of his own by which he may be
  able to live, and it be not through his own folly, that then he shall
  have each week from their common box tenpence half penny for his
  sustenance.

  ITEM. That when any brother of the said Fraternity dies the brethren
  of the said Fraternity shall go on the Vigil to the dirge, and on
  the day[31] to the Mass, and to the dirge and to the mass of the
  month’s obit, and that each such brother dead have thirty masses from
  their common box,[32] and that each brother who is absent without
  reasonable excuse at any of the said four times, shall put into their
  common box in place of his offerings and expenses, as he ought to
  have done if he had been present, three pence.

  [31] The day of the funeral.
  [32] Thirty masses sung at the expense of the common box.

  ITEM. When any Master of the said Fraternity has a wife dead, the
  brethren of the said Fraternity shall be at the Vigil and at the Mass
  on the day of her burial and at the month’s obit, and that brother
  who is absent at any of the three times shall pay for each time that
  he be absent, in place of the costs and other expenses which he would
  have borne if he had been present, three pence to their common box.

  ITEM. That no brother of the said Fraternity entice any servant from
  the service of his master, privily or openly.

  ITEM. If any dispute arise between any of the brethren, which God
  forbid, it is to be amicably settled by the decision of the Masters
  of the said Fraternity [_and they are_] to deal plainly,[33] and that
  no one sue another in other manner than at the assize (_?_) [_and
  then only_] if he be empowered by leave of the said Masters to be
  recorded.

  [33] _i.e._, honestly.

  ITEM. That each brother of the said Fraternity shall come
  each quarter of the year and pay his quarterage to the
  collectors[34] . . . . . .

  [34] I am unable to complete this sentence.

  ITEM. It is agreed between all the said brethren that whoever of them
  refuses his office when it comes to him, if he wishes to be relieved
  of it, that he pay to their common box.

  ITEM. If any brother be absent from their Mass and Feast when it
  shall be once a year, he shall pay so much in offerings and all other
  things as one present.

  ITEM. That none of the said brethren put [?] another out of his
  house.

  ITEM. If any brother by chance delay his payments beyond a
  year-and-a-half, that he make acquittance within two years without
  any [_penalty_] beyond the ordinary fine. And if he be thus forgiven
  that he settle the matter at once.

  AND to hold these points pursuant to amendment alone if the Mystery
  will that they be amended, this Fraternity are sworn among themselves
  and have each of them pledged his troth, and so from each who shall
  [_hereafter_] be of the said Fraternity. And it is agreed amongst
  them that this Indenture be enclosed in their common box, and the
  counterpart be held by the Masters for the time being of the said
  Fraternity.

The document which the Masters found amongst their records made in “the
time to which memory runneth not” probably ends here, and the following
Items (see the third one) were doubtless additional Ordinances made
circa 1387.

  ITEM. That each brother of the said Fraternity pay in pledge for his
  livery, when he has the same, forty pence at the least.

  ITEM. That each brother keep the livery two whole years before he may
  give, or sell, or alienate it in any manner, under pain of paying to
  the Company for their pardon, a noble of gold.

  ITEM. It is ordained that on the Sunday following the Assumption of
  our Lady in the 11th year of King Richard the Second,[35] that the
  Surveyors of the said Mystery be elected by the assent of all the
  Fraternity, and no longer by the Masters.

  [35] 18th Aug., 1387.

  ITEM. That none of the said Fraternity hereafter pay more than
  fourteen pence for his feast.

  ITEM. It is ordained that each Master who shall choose any other man
  to be in his place, that is to say for to be Master; he who shall
  choose such man to be Master for the year shall be bound by himself
  for him, in an obligation to the Company for the money.[36]

  [36] _i.e._, a guarantee for his honesty.

                                     It agrees with the Record,
                                                       WILLIAM COLET.

Coeval with our Company of Barbers there existed in the City of London,
another Fraternity or Guild, that of the Surgeons, in no way connected
with the Barbers, but, like them, existing by prescription only and
unincorporated. It is not to be expected that these two Companies
would, in the days of so much trade protection and jealousy, exhibit
an over-friendly feeling towards one another, and the records of the
period, though meagre, show that this was the case. The Surgeons’ Guild
at no time appear to have been a numerous body, indeed there is reason
to believe that frequently their numbers were less than a dozen, and
they possibly never exceeded twenty.

In the researches undertaken for the purpose of this work, various
references to the Surgeons’ Guild have turned up, and although at this
early period there was much in common between the two Fraternities, I
have considered it quite apart from the subject in hand to go into any
detail concerning that Guild, more especially as it has recently been
so ably and fully dealt with by Mr. D’Arcy Power in his “Memorials of
the Craft of Surgery.”

1376. In the 50th Edward III, the Barbers made a complaint to the Mayor
and Aldermen against unskilled practitioners in Surgery, and prayed
that two Masters should be yearly appointed to inspect and rule the
craft, and that none should be admitted to the freedom of the City, but
upon due examination of their skill; and this was granted by the Court,
entered of record and Lawrence de Weston and John de Grantone were
chosen Masters. The following is a translation of the original record
concerning this matter.[37]

[37] In this and some other cases I have adopted the able translations
made by Mr. Riley in his “Memorials of London and London Life.”

  To the honourable Lords, and wise, the Mayor and Aldermen of the City
  of London, shew the good folks, the Barbers of the same city, that
  whereas from one day to another there resort men, who are barbers,
  from uppelande[38] unto the said city, who are not instructed in
  their craft, and do take houses and intermeddle with barbery,
  surgery, and the cure of other maladies, while they know not how
  to do such things, nor ever were instructed in such craft; to the
  great damage, and in deceit, of the people, and to the great scandal
  of all the good barbers of the said city:--therefore the said good
  folks do pray that it may please your honourable Lordships, for
  the love of God, and as a work of charity, to ordain and establish
  that from henceforth no such stranger, coming to the said City from
  uppelande, or from any other place, of whatsoever condition he be,
  shall keep house or shop for barbery within the same city, before
  that he shall be found able and skilled in the said art and office
  of barbery, and that, by assay and examination of the good folks,
  barbers of the same city, whom out of the said craft it may please
  you to ordain thereunto. And that it may please you to ordain and
  establish, that from henceforth there shall always be two good men of
  their said craft chosen by their common assent to be Wardens of the
  craft; and that such two persons shall be presented unto the Mayor,
  Recorder, and Aldermen, of the said city, and sworn before them well
  and lawfully, to the best of their power and knowledge, to rule their
  said craft; and that the said Masters may inspect the instruments of
  the said art, to see that they are good and proper for the service of
  the people, by reason of the great peril that might ensue thereupon;
  and that on the complaint of such two Masters, all rebellious persons
  in the said craft, shall be made to come before you, and whosoever
  shall be found in default against this Ordinance shall pay to the
  Chamber 40 pence. And that from henceforth no man of their craft
  shall be admitted to the franchise of the said city, if he be not
  attested as being good and able, upon good examination before you
  made. And that no foreigner shall keep house or shop in their craft
  within the said city, or the suburbs thereof. And that this Ordinance
  shall be enrolled in the Chamber of the Guildhall of London, for all
  time to last.

  [38] The general name for country places in those days.

  And the same was granted unto them. Whereupon, Laurence de
  Westone and John de Grantone were chosen Masters of the Barbers.
  [_Letter-Book H. 28._]

The foregoing ordinance must surely have given umbrage to the Surgeons’
Guild as it placed the Barbers upon an equal footing with them in the
examination of Surgeons, the inspection of their instruments, etc.; and
this more especially as seven years previously (in 1369) the Surgeons
had obtained from the same Court an Ordinance investing them with the
power of presenting the defaults of all unskilful Surgeons.

1382. As an example of a quack Surgeon’s method of practice, and of his
rogueries and punishment, the following case of Roger Clerk will be
found interesting:--

  Roger Clerk, of Wandelesworth,[39] on the 13th day of May in the 5th
  year (_Richard II_), was attached in the Chamber of the Guildhall of
  London, before the Mayor and Aldermen, to make answer, as well to the
  Mayor and Commonalty of the City of London, as to Roger atte Hacche,
  in a plea of deceit and falsehood: as to which, the same Roger said,
  that whereas no physician or surgeon should intermeddle with any
  medicines or cures within the liberty of the city aforesaid, but
  those who are experienced in the said arts, and approved therein, the
  said Roger Clerk, who knew nothing of either of the arts aforesaid,
  being neither experienced nor approved therein, nor understood
  anything of letters, came to the house of him, Roger atte Hacche, in
  the parish of St. Martin, in Ismongereslane, in London, on Thursday,
  the morrow of Ash Wednesday, in the 5th year, etc.; and there saw one
  Johanna, the wife of the aforesaid Roger atte Hacche, who was then
  lying ill with certain bodily infirmities, and gave the said Roger,
  her husband, to understand, that he was experienced and skilled in
  the art of medicine, and could cure the same Johanna of her maladies,
  if her husband desired it.

  [39] Wandsworth.

  Whereupon, the said Roger atte Hacche, trusting in his words, gave
  him 12 pence, in part payment of a larger sum which he was to pay
  him, in case the said Johanna should be healed. And upon this, the
  same Roger Clerk then and there gave to the said Roger atte Hacche an
  old parchment, cut or scratched across, being the leaf of a certain
  book, and rolled it up in a piece of cloth of gold, asserting that it
  would be very good for the fever and ailments of the said Johanna;
  and this parchment, so rolled up, he put about her neck, but in no
  way did it profit her; and so, falsely and maliciously, he deceived
  the same Roger atte Hacche. And he produced the said parchment here
  in Court, wrapped up in the same cloth, in proof of the matters
  aforesaid.

  And the said Roger Clerk personally appeared, and the said parchment
  was shown to him by the Court, and he was asked what the virtue of
  such piece of parchment was; whereupon, he said that upon it was
  written a good charm for fevers. Upon being further asked by the
  Court what were the words of this charm of his, he said;--“Anima
  Christi, sanctifica me; Corpus Christi, salva me; in isanguis
  Christi, nebria me; cum bonus Christus tu, lava me.”[40] And the
  parchment being then examined, not one of those words was found
  written thereon. And he was then further told by the Court, that a
  straw[41] beneath his foot would be of just as much avail for fevers,
  as this said charm of his was; whereupon, he fully granted that it
  would be so. And because that the same Roger Clerk was in no way
  a literate man, and seeing that on the examination aforesaid, (as
  well as on others afterwards made,) he was found to be an infidel,
  and altogether ignorant of the art of physic or of surgery; and to
  the end that the people might not be deceived and aggrieved by such
  ignorant persons, etc.; it was adjudged that the same Roger Clerk
  should be led through the middle of the City, with trumpets and
  pipes, he riding on a horse without a saddle, the said parchment and
  a whetstone, for his lies, being hung about his neck, an urinal also
  being hung before him, and another urinal on his back. [_Letter-Book
  H. 145._]

  [40] “Soul of Christ, sanctify me; body of Christ, save me; blood of
  Christ, saturate me; as Thou art good, Christ, wash me.”

  [41] In allusion, perhaps, to the custom of men who were ready to
  perjure themselves, as false witnesses, to go about with a straw
  sticking out from between the foot and the shoe--“men of straw.”
  [Riley.]

1390. In connection with the Surgeons’ Guild, four Master Surgeons of
the City were sworn before the Mayor, etc., in this year, and _they_
were to make scrutiny amongst persons practising the art of Surgery,
and to present defaults. [_Letter-Book H._ 248.] It will be remembered
that in 1369 a somewhat similar Ordinance was made for the Surgeons’
Guild, and this one in 1390 was probably obtained as a set off to the
powers vested in the Barbers by their Ordinance of 1376, and by way
of assertion of equal rights with them in matters surgical. Anyhow
it is very clear that there were two distinct bodies within the City
ruling the craft of Surgery at this period, each, no doubt, claiming
jurisdiction over its own members, and both anxious and ready to
interfere with outsiders, and probably with each other. It is curious
to note that in the Ordinance of 1390, above referred to, the Masters
inspecting are authorised to make scrutiny not only of men, but of
“women undertaking cures, or practising the art of Surgery”; and here,
in the 19th century, we find history repeating itself, and women again
“intermeddling in matters surgical.”

As might be expected the dual scrutiny exercised over persons
practising surgery, by two distinct and antagonistic Companies,
produced considerable jealousy and unpleasantness, and there are
various records extant indicative of cases of attempted interference
with the Barbers’ privileges, one of which is distinctly stated to have
been the work of the Surgeons and Physicians, as doubtless also were
the others.

1410. By _Letter-Book I._ 94, it appears that the Ordinances for the
Barbers made in 1376 were confirmed to them with the significant
addition that they should enjoy the same, “without the scrutiny of
any person or persons of any other craft or trade, under any name
whatsoever other than the craft or trade of the said Barbers, either
as to shaving, making incision, blood letting or any other matters
pertaining to the art of Barbery or of Surgery, in the craft of the
said Barbers now practised, or to be practised hereafter.” This
Ordinance is, I think, clearly directed against the Masters of the
Surgeons’ Guild, who had sought to exercise their authority over the
Barbers using the faculty of Surgery.

1415. Complaint having been made to the Mayor and Aldermen, concerning
the unskilful and fraudulent practice of certain Barbers in matters of
Surgery, the privileges of the Barbers were again recorded, though the
Company who had hitherto nominated their own Masters, were somewhat
shorn of that privilege, as the Mayor, etc., directed the names of all
the Barber (Surgeons) to be brought before them, and after due enquiry,
_they_ selected two of them for Masters, and gave them their charge and
oath.

1416. “Certain trustworthy and discreet” Barber (Surgeons) complained
to the Mayor, etc., that notwithstanding the last order, there were
still unruly members in the craft, and a fresh Ordinance was enacted
which imposed a penalty on offenders.

The Ordinances above referred to are to be found in _Letter-Book I._
149, and are as follows:

  Be it remembered, that on the 10th day of April, in the 3rd year,
  etc. (_1415_) it was intimated in a relation, and not without alarm,
  unto Thomas Fauconer, Mayor, and the Aldermen, how that some barbers
  of the said city, who are inexperienced in the art of surgery, do
  oftentimes take under their care many sick and maimed persons,
  fraudulently obtaining possession of very many of their goods
  thereby; by reason whereof, they are oftentimes made to be worse
  off at their departure than they were at their coming: and that, by
  reason of the inexperience of the same barbers, such persons are
  oftentimes maimed; to the scandal of such skilful and discreet men
  as practise the art of surgery, and the manifest destruction of the
  people of Our Lord the King.

  And the said Mayor and Aldermen, wishing to obviate an evil and
  a scandal such as this, as also, to provide a fitting remedy for
  the same, and considering first, how that the said barbers by
  themselves, without the scrutiny of any other persons of any other
  trade or craft,[42] or under any name whatsoever, have supervision
  and scrutiny over all men following the craft of barbery, and within
  the liberty of the said city dwelling, as to all manner of cases
  touching the art of barbery or the practice of surgery, within the
  cognizance, or to come within the cognizance, of the craft of the
  said barbers;--as by a certain Ordinance, made and ordained in the
  time of Richard Merlawe,[43] late Mayor, and the then Aldermen,
  and in the Chamber of the said City of London enrolled, of record
  fully appears;--did determine and ordain that in future, by the
  more substantial part of all the barbers following the practice
  of surgery, and dwelling within the liberty of the said city,
  there should be chosen two of the most skilful, most wise, and
  most discreet men, of all the barbers following such practice of
  surgery, and dwelling within the liberty of the said city; seeing
  that oftentimes under their scrutiny and correction there would
  be found cases of possible death and maiming, where, if ignorant
  and indiscreet men should undertake the management thereof--the
  which might God forbid--in their judgment grievous errors might
  unexpectedly ensue, by reason of such unskilfulness. And that the
  same Masters, so often as they should be thus chosen, on election
  should be presented to the Mayor and Aldermen, for the time being,
  there by the said Mayor and Aldermen to be accepted and sworn etc.

  [42] See the Ordinance of 1410.
  [43] Mayor 1409-10.

  And lest perchance a difference of opinion might in future as to
  such election arise, therefore, the said Mayor and Aldermen, after
  taking counsel on the matter aforesaid, on Friday, the 3rd day of
  May, in the same year (_1415_), caused to be brought before them the
  name of every barber who followed the practice of surgery and dwelt
  within the liberty of the said city, in order that, after enquiring
  into the duties and experiences of their practice and skill, in
  manner theretofore approved and customary, they might be the better
  able to accept such Masters. And hereupon, because that, among other
  names, Simon Rolf and Richard Wellys, citizens and barbers of the
  said city practising the art of surgery, as well for their knowledge
  and probity, as for the different kinds of difficult cures that had
  been sagaciously performed and effected by them, were by trustworthy
  testimony, upon sound and umblemished information, commended before
  any others, precept was given by the said Mayor and Aldermen to
  Baldwin Tettisbury, one of the serjeants of the said Mayor, to summon
  the said Simon and Richard for Monday the 6th day of May then next
  ensuing, to appear before the said Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber
  of the Guildhall aforesaid, there to make the oath to them by the
  said Mayor and Aldermen to be administered.

  Upon which Monday the said Simon and Richard, by virtue of such
  summons, appeared before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber
  aforesaid. And hereupon the said Simon and Richard were then accepted
  by the said Mayor and Aldermen, and sworn upon the Holy Evangelists
  of God, well and faithfully to watch over and oversee all manner of
  barbers practising the art of surgery, and within the liberty of the
  said city dwelling; to maintain and observe the rules and ordinances
  of the craft or practice aforesaid; no one to spare, for love,
  favour, gain, or hate; diligently without concealment to present unto
  the Chamberlain of the said City, for the time being, such defaults
  as they may find; at all times, when duly required thereto, well and
  faithfully to examine wounds, bruises, hurts, and other infirmities,
  without asking anything for their trouble; and what they should
  find, at their discretion, when duly required thereto, distinctly
  to certify unto the Mayor and Aldermen of the said City, for the
  time being; as also, well and faithfully to conduct themselves from
  thenceforth in future; and all other things to do and perform, which
  of right are befitting or requisite for the masters or overseers of
  such practice to do.

  AFTERWARDS, on the fourth day of July, in the 4th year, etc. (_1416_)
  before Nicholas Wottone, Mayor, the Recorder, and the Aldermen, in
  full Court, upon truthful information of certain trustworthy and
  discreet men of the craft of Barbers, practising the art of surgery
  aforesaid, as of other able and substantial men of the said city, it
  was stated how that, notwithstanding the Ordinance aforesaid, very
  many inexperienced men of the said craft of Barbers, indiscreetly
  practising the art of surgery, did presume, and in their presumption
  pretend, that they were wiser than the Masters inspecting, and, as
  to certain infirmities--indiscreetly excusing themselves therein,
  on the insufficient grounds that they are not liable to the peril
  of maiming or of death--did altogether disdain to give notice of
  the same to the said Masters inspecting, according to the Ordinance
  aforesaid, or to be discreetly examined by them as to the same, or
  diligently to be questioned thereon. Upon which pretence, they did
  not hesitate daily to take sick persons, in peril of death and of
  maiming, under their care, without shewing such sick persons, or such
  infirmities and perils, unto the same Masters inspecting; by reason
  of which presumption or unskilfulness, such sick persons were exposed
  to the greatest peril, either of maiming or of death. Wherefore, the
  said Mayor and Aldermen were prayed that, for the common advantage of
  the whole realm, and the especial honour of the said city, they would
  deign to provide some sure remedy for the same.

  And accordingly, the Mayor and Aldermen, assenting to the said
  petition, as being just and consistent with reason, having taken
  diligent counsel as to the matters aforesaid, and considering that
  very many of such persons in these times are more in dread of loss
  or payment of money than amenable to the dictates of honesty or a
  safe conscience, did ordain and enact, that no barber, practising
  the art of surgery within the liberty of the said City, should
  presume in future to take under his care any sick person who is in
  peril of death or of maiming, unless he should show the same person,
  within three days after so taking him under his care, to the Masters
  inspecting, for the time being, by the barbers practising the art
  of surgery within the liberty of the said City to be elected, and
  to the Mayor and Aldermen presented, and by them specially to be
  admitted; under a penalty of 6_s._ 8_d._ to the Chamber of London in
  form underwritten to be paid, so often as, and when, against this
  Ordinance they should be found to act; namely, 5 shillings to the use
  of the Chamber of the Guildhall, and 20 pence to the use of the craft
  of the Barbers.

1423. In this year certain Ordinances were made by the Mayor (Sir
William Walderne) and Court of Aldermen which are entered in
_Letter-Book K._ 6{B.} This record relates to what Mr. D’Arcy Power,
in his “Memorials of the Craft of Surgery,” has termed a “Conjoint
College” of the Physicians and Surgeons, and has little to do with our
Company, beyond the fact that the scrutiny and oversight of persons
practising Surgery is given to the Masters of the Surgeons’ Guild.
The subject of these Ordinances and many very interesting remarks
thereon and on the Conjoint College may be seen at p. 52, &c., of Mr.
D’Arcy Power’s work; and the record itself is set forth in full at
p. 299; furthermore, extracts from it, so far as the same relate to
the privileges and practice of the Surgeons, are to be found in the
beautiful old vellum MS. formerly belonging to that Guild, and now in
the possession of the Barbers’ Company.

Armed with this additional authority, the Surgeons’ Guild again sought
to interfere with and scrutinize the Barber-Surgeons of the Barbers’
Company. These latter, however, must have had good friends at Court,
and were not slow in asserting and obtaining confirmation of their
rights and privileges, as will be seen by reference to the following
record in _Letter-Book K._ 27{B.}:--

  1424. MEMORANDUM. That on Friday the 10th day of November in the
  third year of the reign of Henry the Sixth from the Conquest
  before John Michell, Mayor, Thomas Knolles and other Aldermen, and
  Simon Seman and John Bithewater, Sheriffs of the City of London,
  It was granted and ordained that the Masters of the faculty of
  Surgery within the craft of Barbers of the same city, do exercise
  the same faculty even as fully and entirely as in the times of
  Thomas Fauconer late Mayor, and other Mayors, it was granted unto
  them, notwithstanding the false accusation (_calumpnia_) which the
  Rector and Supervisors of Physic and the Masters of Surgery pretend
  concerning a certain ordinance made in the time of William Walderne
  late Mayor (_1423_) and entered in the letter book K, folio 6, the
  which, they now endeavour to enjoin upon the said Barbers.

1451. With the exception of a few references (which are noticed
elsewhere) the City records are silent concerning the Barbers’ Company
until this year, when the Master and Wardens, styled here “Gardiani,”
with certain honest men of the Mystery of Barbers, brought a Bill
before the Mayor and Aldermen, praying them to establish certain
Ordinances, and to enter them of record, which was granted and done.

These Ordinances provided for the enforcement of stated penalties
in cases of disobedience and related to attendance upon summons,
settlements of disputes, refusal of office, admission of members, evil
speaking, assemblies and payments, instruction of “foreyns,” employment
of aliens. They are to be found in _Letter-Book K._ 250, and are the
first written in English, all previous ones being either in Latin or
Norman French in the originals.

Nothing is now heard of the Surgeons’ Guild for some years, although
they were still in existence. It is quite probable, that finding the
Barbers had invariably obtained the protection and countenance of the
City authorities, whenever their privileges had been assailed or called
in question, they had given over their attempts at interference with
them as hopeless, and allowed our worthy predecessors to continue to
“exercise the faculty of surgery,” in peace; and being unmolested they
doubtless grew in numbers, in importance, and in the knowledge of their
art, until it was admitted that their position as one of the Guilds,
warranted them in applying for a Charter of Incorporation, which was
granted to them by Edward IV in 1462.

1413. Before proceeding to refer to this important epoch in the history
of our Company, it will be well to introduce a very remarkable
letter, which was written by Thomas Arundell, Archbishop of Canterbury
(formerly of York), to the Mayor, etc., of London, in which he
complained that the Barbers, being, alas! “without zeal for the law of
God,” kept their shops open on the Sabbath days, and he besought the
Mayor and Aldermen (his “sons in Christ, and dearest friends”) to put a
stop to this practice. No trade, perhaps, has from the earliest days,
down to our own times, owned such persistent breakers of the Fourth
Commandment as have the Barbers. Our records abound with by-laws,
enacted and renewed over and over again on this subject, and details
of the delinquencies of numerous Barbers in this respect, and of their
punishments by fine and imprisonment crop up everywhere.

The Archbishop’s letter reveals to us the fact, that nearly 500 years
ago, men were constituted much as they are now; in that “that which
touches the body or the purse, is held more in dread than that which
kills the soul,” and he shrewdly suggests that the clerical punishment
of “the greater excommunication,” should be augmented by a fine to be
levied by the Civil authority. This letter is so deeply interesting
that no apology is needed for reproducing it here. The original is to
be found in _Letter-Book I._ 125.

  1413. On the 24th day of July, in the first year, etc. (Henry V) the
  Reverend Father in Christ, and Lord, Thomas, by Divine permission,
  Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, and Legate of
  the Apostolic See, sent here, to the Mayor and Aldermen of the City
  of London, certain Letters Close of his, containing words as follow:--

  “Sons in Christ and dearest friends.--We know that you do seek for
  the things which are of above, and that you will the more readily
  incline to our desires, the more surely that the things as to which
  we write are known to tend to the observance of the Divine law,
  the maintenance of public propriety, and the rule of the Christian
  profession. We do therefore write unto you on this occasion, to
  intimate that when we were presiding of late in our Provincial
  Council, holden at London, with our venerable brethren, the
  Suffragan Bishops, and our clergy of the Province of Canterbury, it
  was publicly made known unto us with universal reprobation, that
  the Barbers of the City of London, over the governance of which
  city you preside, being without zeal for the law of God, and not
  perceiving how that the Lord hath blessed the seventh day and made
  it holy, and hath commanded that it shall be observed by no abusive
  pursuit of any servile occupations, but rather by a disuse thereof,
  in their blindness do keep their houses and shops patent and open on
  the seventh day, the Lord’s Day, namely, and do follow their craft
  on the same, just as busily, and just in the same way, as on any
  day in the week, customary for such work. Wherefore we, with the
  consent and assent of our said Suffragans and clergy, in restraint
  of such temerity as this, have determined that there must be made
  solemn prohibition thereof in the City aforesaid, and that, of our
  own authority, and that of our said Provincial Council; and not there
  only, but also throughout the Diocese of London, and each of the
  cities both of our own Diocese and of our Province of Canterbury; to
  the effect, that such barbers must not keep their houses and shops
  patent or open, or follow their craft, on such Lord’s Days for the
  future, on pain of the greater excommunication; in the same manner as
  it has been enacted and observed of late in our time, as to the City
  and Diocese of York, as we do well recollect. But, dearest children,
  seeing that so greatly has the malice of men increased in these days,
  a thing to be deplored--that temporal punishment is held more in
  dread than clerical, and that which touches the body or the purse
  more than that which kills the soul, we do heartily intreat you, and,
  for the love of God and of His law, do require and exhort you, that,
  taking counsel thereon, you will enact and ordain a competent penalty
  in money, to be levied for the Chamber of your City, or such other
  purpose as you shall think best, upon the Barbers within the liberty
  of your City aforesaid, who shall be transgressors in this respect;
  that so at least, those whom fear of the anger of God does not avail
  to withold from breach of His law, may be restrained by a scourge
  inflicted upon their purse, in the way of pecuniary loss; knowing
  that we in the meantime, after taking counsel hereon, will devise
  measures for the prevention of this, and for the due publication of
  our Provincial enactment aforesaid. Fare you well always in Christ.

  Written at Ikham[46] on the 13th day of the month of July.

  [46] Near Wingham, Kent.

                                   THOMAS, Archbishop of Canterbury.”

An Ordinance was forthwith made thereupon, to the effect, that no
barber, his wife, son, daughter, apprentice, or servant, should work
at such craft on Sundays within the liberty of the city, either in hair
cutting or shaving, on pain of paying 6_s._ 8_d._ for each offence;
5_s._ thereof to go to the new work at the Guildhall, and the remainder
to the Wardens or Masters of the Barbers within the city.[47]

1422. In August of this year Henry V died, and thirty-two of the City
Companies assisted at his obsequies, going in procession and carrying
torches. From an entry in _Letter-Book K._ 1{B.}, it appears that the
Barbers bore four torches on this occasion.

1447. This year the Company seem to have contributed 40_s._ towards
the cost of the Roof of the Chapel at Guildhall, as appears by the
following entry in _Journal IV_, 198 (25th October, 26 Henry VI)--

THE BARBERS INCORPORATE.


Hitherto we have considered two distinct and somewhat hostile
fraternities, the Surgeons on the one hand, and on the other the
Barbers (consisting of Barbers and Barber-Surgeons), both of them
City Guilds, existing by prescription, having independent rules and
Ordinances for their government and the scrutiny and correction of
abuses in their respective Crafts, the former Company few in number,
the latter far more numerous and popular; the Surgeons without, and the
Barbers with, a Livery.

Of these two fraternities, the Barbers by the regular and every day
nature of their calling, as shavers and hair cutters, together with the
practice of Surgery combined by so many of them, were the most likely
to become the more popular Company; their fees would surely be on a
lower scale than those of the more aristocratic Surgeons, and their
numbers and constant intercourse with the citizens, in their capacity
as Barbers, enabled them easily to extend their connection as Surgeons.

In all their contentions with the Surgeons’ Guild, as far as we know,
they held their own well, and thus it was that their place in the City,
as a Livery Guild of at that time an ancient standing, their position
as the professors of useful and scientific arts, their numbers and
presumable affluence, all rendered it desirable that they should be
placed upon the same footing as the better class of Guilds, by their
acquisition of a Charter of Incorporation, which they accordingly
obtained from the young King Edward IV in the first year of his reign
(1462).

Thomas Knot (Master, 1555) has recorded in one of our books, a
Translation of this Charter, which Mr. J. Flint South (who does not
appear to have seen the original Latin one) has transcribed, and this
has been adopted by Mr. D’Arcy Power (page 326). Thomas Knot wrote a
good hand, and was a zealous champion of the Barber-Surgeons in his
time, but he made egregious blunders in some of the writings recorded
over his signature, and although there is not great fault to be found
with him in this instance, it is suggested that the Translation given
below, is perhaps a more literal one than that which Knot has handed
down.

The Charter is still preserved at our Hall, and is contained on a small
skin of parchment; the initial letters of the title, which were at the
time left to be illuminated have never been filled in, and the document
is therefore not the work of art which one is accustomed to see in
Charters of this period; it bears signs of having been frequently used,
the ink in some places being worn, and the words only legible with the
aid of a magnifying glass. The great seal pendant is not quite perfect,
but is a beautiful specimen and highly artistic. The following is the
text of the Charter:--

  TRANSLATION.

  EDWARD by the grace of God, King of England and France, and Lord of
  Ireland, TO all to whom these present letters shall come, health.
  KNOW ye, that we considering how our beloved, honest, and free men
  of the Mystery of Barbers of our City of London, exercising the
  Mystery or Art of Surgery, as well respecting wounds, bruises, hurts,
  and other infirmities of our liegemen, and healing and curing the
  same, as in letting blood, and drawing the teeth of our liege men,
  have for a long time undergone and supported, and daily do undergo
  and support, great and manifold applications and labours; and also,
  how through the ignorance negligence and stupidity of some of the
  men of the said Barbers, as well of the freemen of our said City,
  as of other Surgeons foreigners and not freemen of the said City,
  and who daily resort to the said City, and in the mystery of Surgery
  are not sufficiently skilled, whereby very many and almost infinite
  evils have before this time happened to many of our liegemen, in
  their wounds, hurts, bruises, and other infirmities, by such Barbers
  and Surgeons, on account of their defect in healing and curing;
  from which cause, some of our said liegemen have gone the way of
  all flesh, and others, through the same cause, have been by all
  given over as incurable and past relief, and it is to be dreaded,
  that similar or greater evils may in future arise on this head,
  unless proper remedy is by us, speedily provided for the same. WE
  therefore, heartily weighing and considering that such evils do
  happen to our liegemen for want of the examinations, corrections,
  and punishments by a due supervision of such Barbers and Surgeons
  as are insufficiently skilled and instructed in the said mysteries
  or arts as aforesaid; have at the humble request of our aforesaid
  beloved, honest, and freemen of the said Mystery of Barbers in our
  said city, granted to them that the said Mystery, and all men of the
  said Mystery aforesaid, may be in deed and name one body and one
  perpetual Community, and that two Principals of the said Community
  may, with the consent of twelve persons, or at least eight of the
  said Community who are best skilled in the mystery of Surgery, every
  year elect and make out of the Community, two Masters or Governors
  of the utmost skill, to superintend rule and govern the Mystery
  and Community aforesaid and all men of the said Mystery, and of
  the businesses of the same for ever. AND THAT the said Masters or
  Governors and Community may have a perpetual succession and common
  seal to serve for the affairs of the said Community for ever, and
  that they and their successors for ever may be able and capable to
  acquire and possess in fee and perpetuity lands, tenements, rents,
  and other possessions whatsoever, to the value of five marks per
  annum, besides reprises. And that they, by the name of the Masters
  or Governors and Community of Barbers of London, may be able to
  plead and to be impleaded before whatsoever Justices in Courts,
  and actions whatsoever. And that the said Masters or Governors and
  Community, and their successors, may lawfully and honestly assemble
  themselves, and make statutes and ordinances for the wholesome
  government, superintendence, and correction of the said Mystery,
  according to the exigency of the necessity, as often and whenever
  it may be requisite, lawfully and unpunishably, without leave or
  hindrance of us, our heirs or successors, Justices, Escheators,
  Sheriffs, Coroners, or any other Bailiffs, or servants of us, our
  heirs or successors; provided that such statutes or ordinances are
  not in any ways contrary to the laws and customs of our Kingdom of
  England. WE FURTHER will and grant, for us, our heirs and successors,
  as far as in us lies, that the Masters or Governors of the aforesaid
  Community for the time being, and their successors for ever, shall
  have the superintendence, scrutiny, correction, and government of
  all and singular the freemen of the said City who are Surgeons,
  exercising the Mystery of Barbers within the said City, and of
  all other foreign Surgeons whomsoever, in anywise practising and
  using the said Mystery of Surgeons in the said City and the suburbs
  thereof, and the punishment of them, as well freemen as foreigners,
  for their offences in not perfectly following, practising and using
  that mystery, and also the superintendence and scrutiny of all kinds
  of instruments, plaisters, and other medicines, and their recipes,
  by such Barbers and Surgeons given, applied, and used for our liege
  men, for curing and healing their wounds, bruises, hurts and such
  kind of infirmities, when and as often as shall be requisite for the
  convenience and utility of our liege men; so that punishment of such
  Barbers exercising the said mystery of Surgeons, so offending in the
  premisses, be executed by fines, amerciaments, and imprisonments
  of their bodies, and by other reasonable and suitable means; and
  that no Barber exercising the said mystery of Surgeons in the said
  City and suburbs thereof, or any other foreign Surgeon whatsoever,
  shall in future be admitted to follow, practise and exercise the
  said mystery of Surgeons, in anywise, within the said City or the
  suburbs thereof, unless he be first approved by the said Masters or
  Governors, or their successors, for this purpose able and sufficient
  as skilled in the said Mystery, and for his plenary approbation in
  this behalf, by the said Masters or Governors to the Mayor of the
  said City for the time being, presented. WE ALSO will and grant,
  for us our heirs and successors, as far as in us lies, that neither
  the said Masters or Governors and community of the said Mystery of
  Barbers, nor their successors, nor any of them shall hereafter, in
  anywise be summoned or appointed on any assizes, juries, inquests,
  inquisitions, attainders, or other recognizances, within the said
  City or suburbs thereof for the time to come, before the Mayor or
  Sheriffs or Coroners of our said City for the time being, by any
  summoning officer or his servant, or summoning officers or their
  servants, although the said juries, inquisitions, or recognizances
  should be summoned by a writ or writs of right, of us or our
  heirs, but that the said Masters or Governors and Community of the
  aforesaid Mystery and their successors shall, from henceforth for
  ever, be peaceably and entirely exonerated towards us, our heirs and
  successors, and towards the Mayor and Sheriffs of our said City for
  the time being, and every of their officers and servants, by these
  presents. AND FURTHER, we, in consideration of the premisses, do of
  our special grace, for us and our successors, grant to the said
  Masters or Governors and Community of the said Mystery of Barbers,
  and their successors, this liberty, to wit, that they in all future
  times may admit and receive persons apt and sufficiently skilled
  and informed in the said Mystery of Surgery, and by the Masters or
  Governors for the time being of the said Mystery, in manner aforesaid
  approved, and presented to the Mayor of the said City for the time
  being as aforesaid, into the said Mystery of Barbers to the fredom of
  the said City, to be held and enjoyed according to the custom of the
  said City; and no other persons whomsoever, nor in any other manner,
  any mandate or requisition of us, our heirs or successors, by written
  letters or otherwise howsoever made or to be made to the contrary
  notwithstanding. AND ALTHOUGH the said Masters or Governors and
  Community and their successors should contumaciously use this liberty
  in future against any mandate or requisition of us, our heirs, or
  successors, or any others whomsoever to be made in form aforesaid,
  neither they nor any of them shall in anywise incur any fine,
  contempt, or loss towards us, our heirs or successors, or any damage
  or punishment in their goods or bodies, or towards any other persons
  whatsoever, on that account; AND this without fine or fee for the
  sealing of these presents, to be done paid or otherwise rendered unto
  us; any statute, ordinance, or any act to the contrary, before this
  time published made ordained or provided notwithstanding IN WITNESS
  whereof, we have caused these our letters to be made patent. WITNESS
  myself at Westminster the twenty-fourth day of February in the first
  year of our reign.

                                                       PEKHAM.

      By writ of privy seal, and of the date aforesaid, by authority of
      Parliament, and for ten pounds paid into the hanaper.

      (Endorsed.)

      Inrolled in the Court of the Lord the King, in the chamber of
      the Guildhall of the City of London in the book marked with the
      letter l. folio thirteen in the third year of the reign of King
      Edward the Fourth from the Conquest.

The chief point which strikes us on reading the foregoing Charter is,
that it contains a great deal relative to Surgery, and little, indeed
nothing, concerning Barbery, and yet it is granted ostensibly to the
Barbers!

Now the Surgical side being the more important one of the craft, and
the _raison d’être_ of the Charter being in a great measure to provide
for the regulation of Surgery and the correction of abuses in that
profession, this silence as to Barbery and recognition of Surgery would
seem to be an evidence that the practice of the latter, more or less,
was the rule rather than the exception with members of the Company
of Barbers; and, as the Masters or Governors were empowered to make
“statutes and ordinances” (by-laws) for the governance of the mystery,
it was doubtless considered unnecessary to descend into any details
concerning shaving and the like in a Royal Charter.

The preamble of this Charter is exceedingly quaint and interesting,
reciting how through the “ignorance, negligence and stupidity” of
various Barbers and other practitioners in Surgery, many of the King’s
lieges had “gone the way of all flesh.” Then at the request of “our
beloved, honest and free men of the said Mystery of Barbers,” the King
grants to them, to be one body perpetual, etc., that two of the chief
men of the Company (no doubt the two then existing Masters “exercising
the faculty of Surgery”) may with twelve or at least eight other
skilled Barber-Surgeons, elect two Masters annually: this provision
in itself is singular, as it would seem to imply that the body then
incorporated was to be ruled by two Masters only; but a reference to
our list of Masters and Wardens will shew that from the year 1448
the Company has been ruled by four Masters, and so on in unbroken
succession to the present time[48]; these other two Masters therefore
were Masters of the Barbers proper, about whom nothing was said in
the Charter, but who were chosen annually in accordance with ancient
custom, the Chief or First Master being alternately a Barber, and a
Barber-Surgeon.

[48] The term “Wardens” is a more modern designation used for
convenience sake; the Master and the three Wardens are, strictly
speaking, the four “Masters or Governors.”

The Corporation was to have perpetual succession, and a Common seal,
to hold lands of a certain value, to be able to plead and to be
impleaded, to make by-laws, to have the scrutiny and correction of
(apparently _all_) Surgeons in the City and suburbs, as also the
oversight of all their instruments and medicines, etc., and to have the
power of inflicting punishment, by fine or imprisonment, on offenders.
None were to practise Surgery until examined and approved by the
Masters and presented to the Mayor, and authority was given for the
freemen of the Company to be admitted into the freedom of the City.

Another clause in the Charter was one which, whilst it conferred a
valuable privilege upon the Company, was a source of continual strife
and conflict with the Civic authorities, for by it _all_ our freemen
claimed to be exempted from serving on Juries and inquisitions, and
this immunity, though constantly disputed, was as often asserted and
maintained, with various qualifications.

In _The Times_, November 26, 1839, is an account of the exemption of
certain freemen of the Company from serving on Juries at the Central
Criminal Court. In this instance neither the claimants nor the Recorder
knew much about the matter--for one of the applicants said, in reply to
the Recorder, “I rest my claim on the Charter of _Henry VIII_”_!!_ And,
further on in the discussion, the same bold Barber had the effrontery
to declare that “the privilege was confirmed by an Act passed in the
reign of George II.” This was the Act which separated the Surgeons from
the Barbers, and which did _not_ confirm to the latter the exemption
claimed, but our freeman gained his point, and the Recorder only
grumbled.

As recently as 1868, a case was submitted to Sir J. D. Coleridge (now
Lord Chief Justice) as to the legality of the exemption, and he gave
his opinion in favour of it. However, since then the Jury Act has,
alas! swept away this cherished immunity, and thus let the Barbers down
to the level of their fellow citizens.

With the possession of their Charter the Company were now in an
unassailable position, and we hear no more of their molestation by the
Guild of Surgeons.

[Illustration: _Grant_ by RICHARD THORNBURY, Citizen and Draper of
London, to Robert Ferbras, Citizen and Surgeon, John Dagvile, Surgeon,
William Sipnam, Grocer, and Walter Bartlot, Fishmonger, Citizens of
London, for ever, of all his title in two shops and solars with their
appurtenances, in the parish of Saint John upon Walbroke, formerly
belonging to John Blounde of Braughyng in the County of Hertford, and
which had been already conveyed to the Grantees by John Thornbury,
gentleman, and Walter Thornbury, Clerk, which shops were situate
between the tenements of William Horn, Citizen and Draper, towards
the north and south, and the tenement of the Prior and Convent of the
Blessed Mary without Bishopsgate towards the east, and the King’s
highway leading from Walbroke to Dowgate towards the west. Dated 11th
May, 2 Edward IV (1462).]

1470. The Company about this period came into possession of some
freehold houses in St. John the Baptist upon Walbrook, to be held
both for trust and corporate purposes. These houses are stated in our
books to have been devised to us by Will (dated 2nd Dec., 1470) of
Robert Ferbras. There are three old title deeds of the period still
at the Hall, relating to these houses, and in the Court of Husting at
Guildhall are two Wills of Robert Ferbras, Surgeon, both proved, one
dated 4th Nov., 1470, and the other 17th April, 1472--but neither of
these contain the bequest to the Barbers. It is, therefore, probable
that Robert Ferbras conveyed the houses to the Company in his lifetime,
and this fact being overlooked in course of years, it came to be said
that they passed by his Will.

1482. 26th April.--The Company applied to the Court of Aldermen,
presenting a set of ordinances for the government of the craft and for
the regulation of apprentices, praying that the same might be allowed
and ratified, which was done. The official entry under this date is in
_Letter-Book L._ 174, and the following are the Ordinances:--

  iiij{d.}

Then follows the usual Ratification (in Latin) of the above Articles.

1487. The next notice which we have of the Barbers in the City books,
indicates that there had been quarrels and dissensions among them, and
that the rules of the Craft had been set at nought by its members,
whereupon a Book of Ordinances was presented to the Court of Aldermen
for approval and ratification and the same is entered at this date, 20
July 2 Hen vij, in _Letter-Book L._ 235{B.} as follows:--

Then follows the usual Ratification (in Latin) of the above Articles.

1490. A declaration made by one Bryan Sandford, dated 8th March, 1490,
was produced to the Committee of the House of Commons in 1745, in
which it was stated that the Company were at that time possessed of the
freehold of their Hall in Monkwell Street.

1493. On the 12th July in this year, an agreement was entered into
between the Barbers’ Company and the Surgeons’ Guild which would
indicate that the two bodies were now on amicable terms, working
harmoniously for the increase of the credit of the profession, and
for the correction of inexperienced surgeons and empirics. This
“Composition” is of so interesting a nature that it is here given in
full, as extracted from the fine old Book of Ordinances at the Hall; it
did not unite the two bodies in any way beyond this, that they agreed
to follow the same rules and practice with regard to the government of
all Surgeons; that each guild was to choose two Wardens, and that the
four so chosen were to act in a conjoint capacity as rulers or masters
in matters surgical, and thus comprehend all Surgeons, whether of the
Barbers’ Company, the Surgeons’ Guild, or “foreyns.”

Of the persons assenting to this composition, the following were
Barber-Surgeons, viz.: Rob{t.} Halyday (Master 1475, 1483, 1485, 1490,
1496), James Scott (M. 1493, 1498, 1500), James Ingoldysby (M. 1501,
1506), John Taylour (M. 1523, 1524), and Nicholas Leveryng(M. 1503,
1508), the others were most likely belonging to the Guild of Surgeons.

An Ordinance by way of addenda to the above was made, imposing
penalties upon any who should break any of the foregoing rules; the
first offence to be punished by a fine of 10_s._, the second 20_s._,
and the third offence to be remitted to the Mayor and Aldermen for
punishment after their discretion.

SURGEONS IN 1492. (_See p. 433._)]

How long this agreement, so beneficial for the practice of Surgery,
continued in force is unknown; but the probabilities are that the old
jealousies soon re-appeared and that each Guild worked on its own
lines until 1540, as, by the uniting Act then passed, it was specially
remarked as desirable that the two Companies should come together, and
be incorporated in one.

1497. We shall now present to the reader’s notice a highly important
document, being a diploma granted by the Master and Wardens of the
Barbers’ Company to one of their freemen, enabling him to practise as
a Surgeon. This is in all probability the earliest English diploma of
a Surgeon extant and cannot fail by the quaintness of its composition,
and the details given, to prove of much interest. We notice in it, that
our Company as usual, did not fail to rehearse its prerogatives and
practice, and we also observe that thus early the Company provided an
instructor and examiner in the science, Dr. John Smith, before whom
came in the Common Hall, Robert Anson, and in the presence of a “great
audience of many right well expert men in Surgery and others, was
openly examined in divers things concerning the practice,” etc.

1499. In this year the Company obtained from Henry VII a confirmation
of their Charter, paying but 20_s._ for the same. This Inspeximus
Charter recites and confirms that of Edward IV with the very noticeable
exceptions, that four Masters or Governors are named instead of
two, and that they are described as of “the Mystery of Barbers and
Surgeons,” and not “Barbers” only, as in Edward’s grant.

pendant, is at the Hall, and the text is as follows:--

1511. In this year an Act of Parliament was passed, which infringed
on the privileges of the Barbers’ Company, inasmuch as it placed the
approbation and licensing of Surgeons in the hands of certain clerical
dignitaries, to wit, the Bishop of London and Dean of St. Paul’s
(while for the country the several Bishops or their Vicars general
were nominated). This Act was possibly the outcome of some laxity on
the part of our Company, or of an intolerable growth of quackery, with
which it could not cope, the pretenders to surgical knowledge being
a “great multitude” of ignorant persons, and women, using sorcery,
witchcraft and noxious remedies. This Act of Parliament (3 Hen. VIII,
cap. XI) as given below, is from an original copy in the possession of
Mr. Charles J. Shoppee (Master 1878).


¶ AN ACTE CONCERNYNG THE APPROBATION OF PHISICIONS AND SURGIONS.

  To the kyng our souerayne lorde, and to all the lordes spiritual
  and temporall, & comoñs in this present parlyament assembled.
  FORASMOCHE as the science and connynge of phisike & surgerie (to
  the perfet knowlege whereof, be requisite both great lernyng and
  rype experience) is dayly within this realme exercised by a great
  multitude of ignorant pˀsons: of whome the great part haue no maner
  of insight in the same, nor in any other kynde of lernynge, some also
  can no letters on the boke, so farforthe that common artificers, as
  smythes, weauers, and women, boldely and customably take upon them
  greate cures and thinges of greate difficultie: in the whiche they
  partly use sorcerye, and witchcrafte, partly apply suche medicines
  unto the disease, as be very noyous and nothyng metely therfore to
  the highe displeasure of god, great infamye to the facultie, and the
  greuous hurte, damage, and destruction of many of the kynges liege
  people: most specially of them that can not discerne the unconnynge
  from connynge. Be it therfore (to the suertie and comforte of all
  maner people) by auctoritie of this present parliament enacted,
  that no persone within the citie of London, nor within seuen myles
  of the same, take upon hym to exercise and occupie as a phisition
  or surgion, excepte he be fyrst examyned, approued, and admytted
  by the byshop of London, or by the deane of Paules, for the tyme
  beinge, calling to hym or them foure doctours of phisike, and for
  surgery, other experte persons in that facultie, and for the fyrste
  examination suche as they shall thynke conuenient, and afterwarde
  alway foure of them that haue ben so approued, upon the peine of
  forfayture, for euery moneth that they do occupie as phisitions or
  surgions, not admytted nor examyned after the tenour of this acte, of
  v.li. to be enployed the one halfe therof to thuse of our soueraine
  lorde the kynge, and the other halfe therof to any person that
  wyll sue for it by action of dette, in whiche no wager of lawe nor
  protection shalbe alowed.

  ¶ And ouer this, that no persone out of the sayd citie and precinte
  of vii. myles of the same, except he haue ben (as is aforesayd)
  approued in y{e} same, take upon hym to exercise and occupie as a
  phisition or surgion, in any diocesse within this realme, but if he
  be fyrste examined and approued by the bysshoppe of the same dyocese,
  or he beynge out of the dioces by his vycare generall: either of
  them callyng to them suche experte persones in the sayde faculties,
  as their discretion shal thynke conuenient, and gyuyng theyr letters
  testimonials under theyr seale to hym that they shall so approue,
  upon lyke peyne to them that occupie contrary to this acte (as
  is above sayde) to be leuied and employed after the forme before
  expressed.

  ¶ Prouyded alway, that this acte nor any thynge therin contayned, be
  preiudiciall to the uniuersities of Oxforde and Cambrydge or eyther
  of them, or to any priuileges graunted to them.

This Act seems to have invested the Bishops, etc., with the power
of licensing _all_ Surgeons, and if so, would have taken away that
privilege from our Company; the point is however doubtful, and I am
inclined to think that the Act did not operate to the prejudice of the
Company, only in so far as it suffered from the existence of another
licensing authority.

Mr. D’Arcy Power has pointed out that the Act very soon became
unpopular, and that it was almost immediately practically repealed by
another one, which provided that it should be “lawful to any person
being the king’s subject, having knowledge or experience of the nature
of herbs, etc., to minister in and to any outward sore or wound
according to their cunning.” (Memorials of the Craft of Surgery, p. 85.)

This latter Act, which in its effect would flood the land with quacks,
must however have remained the law until the Act of 32 Hen. VIII,
whereby the Barber-Surgeons were reinstated in their ancient rights;
and it is the fact, that down to the 18th Century the Ecclesiastics
claimed and enforced their rights (under the Act 3 Hen. VIII) to
license Surgeons, notwithstanding other Acts passed since then, which
although not expressly extinguishing their power, certainly did not
save it. The Barber-Surgeons’ Company seem to have examined the
Surgeons, and, if approved, to have given a certificate under Seal,
which was presented to the Bishop who thereupon issued his licence.
This practice was not however universal, and I think only applied
to some Surgeons who were not free of the Company. In some cases
the Bishop licensed Surgeons, without reference to the Company, and
thousands have been licensed by the Company without regard to the
Bishop. It is almost impossible to say now what course was followed,
the practice certainly varying with the times (see Surgery).

1513. In this year an Act of Parliament was passed exempting Surgeons
from juries, inquests, etc. This must have been passed in the interest
of the Surgeons’ Guild, as the Barber-Surgeons were surely exempt under
their Charter from Edward IV.

1512. The Barbers’ Company having applied to the King (Henry VIII) for
a confirmation of their Charter, their request was acceded to. Henry
is, on more than one occasion, spoken of in the books as “our patron,”
and there is no doubt but that he was very friendly both to our Company
and to individual members of it, as witness his gift of the grace cup,
and the legacies in his will to various members of the Company, with
some of whom, as Pen, Harman, Ayliff, etc., he was on as intimate terms
as a king could be with a subject; there would therefore be, we may be
sure, but little difficulty in obtaining an Inspeximus.

In one of our Minute Books, Thomas Knot (Master 1555) has transcribed
what purports to be a copy of Henry’s Inspeximus Charter with the date
12{th} of May “in the xviij{th} yere of our Reigne” (_i.e._, 1526), and
he appends a certificate that he has compared and agreed it with the
original! Now we possess the original at Barbers’ Hall and it is dated
12{th} March 3{rd} Henry VIII (_i.e._, 1512), and it would indeed be a
strange thing for Henry VIII in 1526 to recite and confirm Henry VII’s
Charter, when he had already done so in 1512. Moreover I have searched
the Patent Rolls and whilst there is no record in 1526, there is the
entry of the 1512 Charter, and further to fix the date, both Philip
and Mary, and Elizabeth in their Inspeximus Charters recite the 1512
Charter.

It has been necessary to enter into this detail, as the date of the
Charter is important when we come to consider Holbein’s picture; and as
my friend Mr. D’Arcy Power has (p. 338) quoted this pretended Charter
not having seen the real one, he, very naturally trusting old Thomas
Knot’s statement, has fallen into the pit dug some three hundred years
ago.

The following is the Text of the Charter, and it will not be necessary
to append a translation, as it follows much on the same lines as that
of Henry VII:--

An Act of Parliament was passed in the 20th Henry VII, which provided
that the governing bodies of Guilds should not make any by-laws or
ordinances, without the same should be approved by the Chancellor, the
Lord Treasurer, and the Chief Justices of the King’s Bench and Common
Pleas, or any three of them, etc., and in 1530 our Company, being
desirous of settling many points for the government of the mystery,
drew up a long set of interesting Ordinances, which were presented
to Sir Thomas More the Chancellor, Sir John Fitzjames and Sir Robert
Norwiche the Chief Justices, and were signed by them on the 14th May,
1530. The original (with More’s autograph) is at the Hall, and after
reciting the Act of 20th Henry VII, ordains the following oaths and
articles:--

  The oath of a freeman.
  The oath of the Masters and Governors with directions as to searches.
  Ordinance as to attending on summons.
      "      "    quarterage.
      "      "    presentation of apprentices.
      "      "    number of servants to be kept by freemen and
                    liverymen.
      "      "    wages of servants.
      "      "    enticing away of servants.
      "      "    opening shop.
      "      "    teaching the mystery to any but apprentices.
      "      "    sueing brother freemen at common law.
      "      "    “opprobrios condicions or dishonest wordes.”
      "      "    refusal to come on the Livery, and admission into
                    the Livery.
      "      "    Sunday trading.
      "      "    presenting patients in danger of death.
      "      "    reading Lectures concerning Surgery.
      "      "    supplanting another of his patient.
      "      "    the Dinners.
      "      "    excess of words in debate.
      "      "    departing from the Common assembly.
      "      "    seniority.
      "      "    Barbers setting up shop.

Sir Thomas More’s Ordinances, as above, will be found in full in the
Appendix B, the transcript being made from the original.[76]

[76] The copy of these Ordinances given by Mr. D’Arcy Power (p. 339)
is taken from one made by our old friend Thomas Knot, and is not
literally, though it is substantially, accurate.

1540. This year is one of the most memorable in the annals of the
Barber-Surgeons, as it witnessed the union of the unincorporated
Guild of Surgeons, with their more accredited fellow-craftsmen, the
incorporated Company of Barbers. It has been suggested by more than
one writer that such an union is shrouded in mystery, difficult of
explanation, and that in those days, with science advancing (slowly,
it is true), it might have been expected that we should read of a
divorcement, rather than a combination of two crafts, which then, as
now, were dissimilar both in their operations, and in the training and
intelligence necessary for their practice.

But it is essential to bear in mind that though the Charter of
Edward IV was ostensibly to the Barbers, it really was granted to a
fraternity, which to a great extent practised as Barber-Surgeons, some
of whom were Surgeons pure and simple, others combined both branches,
while others still carried on the more humble craft of Shavers and
Hair-Dressers; those of the Company who practised Surgery did no doubt
consider it a reproach to be dubbed “Barbers,” and for distinction sake
called themselves and were well known as “Barber-Surgeons,” indeed they
had so far established this title to themselves and to their Company,
as to get it recognised and so named in the Inspeximus Charter of Henry
VII (less than forty years after their original Charter as “Barbers”
had been granted to them). This is to a great extent confirmed by the
words of the Act now about to be referred to, which distinctly says
that there was then a Company of “Surgeons occupyinge and exercisynge
the sayde scyence and faculty of surgery . . . . . . commonly called
the Barbours of London.”

The Union therefore was not a joining of Barbers with Surgeons (THAT
had existed from the earliest times), but was the consolidation
of the “Guild of Surgeons” with another body of Surgeons who were
incorporated, and practised under the name of “Barbers” in conjunction
with actual working Barbers; and, as the Act provided what the Surgeons
should and should not do, and the like as to actual Barbers, limiting
their operations also, most if not all difficulty and apparent
incongruity in the union seems to vanish.

The Act (32 Hen. VIII, cap. 42) which will well repay perusal, settled
the Barber-Surgeons in their corporate capacity for many a long year;
under it the old rival society disappeared, it being declared that the
two Companies should be united, so that by their assembling together,
the science of Surgery might be fostered and improved; whereupon it
was enacted that they should be incorporated under the style of “THE
MAISTERS OR GOVERNOURS OF THE MYSTERY AND COMMINALTE OF BARBOURS AND
SURGEONS OF LONDON.” The property of the old Company of Barbers was
handed over to the new Corporation (the Guild of Surgeons are not said
to have had any property to bring into the new concern). The usual
grant of a common seal, of power to plead and to be impleaded, to hold
lands, etc., will be seen at large in the Act. The Surgeons of the
Company were to be exempt from bearing armour or being put into watches
and inquests. The dead bodies of four malefactors were assigned to
the Company yearly for dissections. And, inasmuch as various persons
exercising the faculty of Surgery used to take into their houses
for cure, people afflicted with the pestilence and other contagious
diseases and “do use or exercise barbari, as washynge or shavyng and
other feates thereunto belonging,”[77] the same was declared “veraie
perillous,” and it was enacted that no one using the faculty of Surgery
should practise Barbery, and that no Barber should practise any point
in Surgery, the drawing of teeth only excepted. The Surgeons were to
exhibit a sign in front of their houses, and no Barber was to exercise
his calling unless free of the Company. Four Masters were to rule the
Company, whereof two were to be Barbers and two Surgeons. A penalty was
named for offenders against the articles, all were to pay scot and lot,
and private persons might keep their own Barber or Surgeon, without
interference by the Company.

[77] Here we have the common practice of the joint craftsman, the
“Barber-Surgeon,” clearly indicated.

The Act was passed on the 24th July, 1540, and will be found in
Appendix C. being taken from the original Black-letter copy in the
Author’s possession.

We now refer to the Company’s chief treasure, the Holbein picture, and
are at once met with a difficulty; does it represent the _granting
of a Charter_ to the Company? if so, the year was 1512; or does
it illustrate the union of the Barbers and Surgeons by _Act of
Parliament_? if so, the year was 1540.

The picture exhibits a Charter with the Great Seal pendant, and has
always been popularly known and described as the “granting of the
Charter to the Barber-Surgeons.” On the other hand, however, the King
was but 21 years of age in 1512 and 49 years in 1540, which latter
age accords with the picture; moreover, Vicary, Ayleff, Harman, and
the others represented, were members of the Court in the latter year,
but not in 1512. These considerations are sufficient to demolish the
“Charter” theory, and point to the hypothesis that it is the Union of
the Barbers’ Company with the Guild of Surgeons, accomplished by Act
of Parliament in 1540, which is _commemorated_, but then we must admit
a licence on the part of Holbein (which deceived no one at the time),
when he indulged his artist’s fancy by putting into the King’s hand
a Charter with seal pendant, instead of an Act of Parliament, which
latter would not indeed have been the King’s function to hand to the
Company, and would probably, if represented, have been depicted as a
mere roll, and not therefore so artistic or effective as a Charter with
a Seal in the King’s hand.

The Act received the Royal Assent 25th July, 1540; this would be
towards the close of the year of John Pen’s mastership. Vicary, who
is receiving the Instrument, was Master from September, 1541, to
September, 1542; there is every probability that the painting was
executed during his year of office, and that is why Holbein paid him
the compliment of putting him in the chief position in the painting,
which after all was intended, not as a strictly historical, but rather
as a commemorative picture.

The picture is 10 feet 2 inches long by 5 feet 11 inches high, painted
on oak panel and contains nineteen figures; it represents a room in
the palace (said to have been Bridewell), which is hung with beautiful
tapestry and appears to have been gilded; the King is seated on a
throne, his age apparently about fifty, the complexion florid, the
hair sandy, the eyes small but animated and restless; the expression
on the countenance is impatience, and he seems thrusting the document
hastily into the hand of Thomas Vicary, who receives it kneeling, on
his left; the face altogether might be pronounced handsome, were it
not for the low forehead and contracted eyebrows; he has on his left
thumb a signet ring, and other rings on the first and fourth fingers
of his right hand with which he holds a sword of state resting on his
knee; on his head is a jewelled crown; on his left leg the garter, and
round his neck the collar of the Order; the mantle is short and of
crimson velvet; all these ornaments are most beautifully executed and
are as fine as miniature painting; every hair of his head is distinct,
and the texture of his robe is finely given; his impatience seems to
have warmed him, and the rising colour flushing over his face is most
admirably painted. On the King’s right are three grave and closely
shaved personages on their knees. The first is Dr. John Chambre, one
of the Royal Physicians, he is represented in a skull cap and furred
gown, the sleeves very large and in which his hands are enwrapped; from
the expression of his countenance it would seem that he was anything
but pleased with the provisions of the Act, as the face has a sullen
and discontented look; next to him is the celebrated Dr. William Butts,
also one of Henry’s Physicians, and behind him is Thomas Alsop, the
Royal Apothecary, his hair is long and lank, and features coarse and
hard.

[Illustration]

On the King’s left are fifteen members of the Court on their knees,
and in livery gowns, evidently specially sumptuous for the occasion,
being of brocaded or damask silk, trimmed with fur, and each man wears
a livery hood of red and black upon his shoulder. The first of these
is Thomas Vicary, Serjeant-Surgeon, who wears a gold chain; next comes
Sir John Ayleff, Surgeon to the King, also with a gold chain and a ring
on his finger, the next is Nicholas Simpson, King’s Barber, who, like
Vicary and Ayleff, wears a skull cap, all the others have their heads
bare. Then comes Edmund Harman, King’s Barber, and one of the Witnesses
to Henry’s Will, he wears a gold chain; next him is James Monforde,
King’s Surgeon, then John Pen, the King’s Barber, and Nicholas Alcocke;
the expression on the countenances of all these men is grave and
solemn; the next, Richard Ferris, who has a somewhat merrier face, and
was also King’s Surgeon, completes the front row. The moustaches and
beards of the whole, including the King, would appear as if they had
had great care and attention bestowed upon them. Of the remaining seven
figures in the back row, the names of but two have been preserved,
viz., Christopher Salmond and William Tilley.

This picture of Holbein’s is not surpassed, if indeed it is equalled,
by any other of that master, every part is most elaborately and
delicately finished; the position of none of the figures is
constrained, and there is no attempt at theatrical effect, yet every
person represented is in action, the colouring is chaste, and kept
down, nor is there any of that hardness and stiffness often observed
in Holbein’s pictures. Its reputation has been truly said to be
world-wide, whilst it has been eulogistically described by some one to
be “as glowing as a Titian, and minutely faithful as a Gerard Dow.”[78]

[78] Part of the above description has been adapted from an anonymous
paragraph, which I found interleaved in Allen’s History of London, at
the Guildhall Library.

The names of the persons represented have been somewhat rudely affixed
to their effigies, probably a few years after the picture was painted,
and whilst we cannot but deplore the disfigurement, it is more than
compensated for, as the means of identification of so many of our
illustrious predecessors. The tablet, with inscription, has been said
to be of later date than Holbein’s work, and to have been painted over
a window, through which was once seen the old church of St. Bride;
this, however, is most improbable, as it is personally dedicatory to
Henry. The inscription is as follows:--

TRANSLATION.

  To Henry the Eighth, the best and greatest King of England, France,
  and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and next to Christ, supreme
  head of the Church of England and Ireland, the Company of Surgeons
  dedicate these, with their united prayers.

    A grievous plague had ravaged the region of England,
      Afflicting man’s spirits and penetrating his frame;
    God, pitying from on high this remarkable scourge
      Commanded thee to perform the office of a good physician.

    The light of the gospel flies around on glowing wings,
      This will be the balm to enfeebled minds:
    Whilst the disciples of Galen meet to raise a monument to thee,
      And all disease is swiftly dispelled by thy power.

    We, therefore, a suppliant band of thy Physicians,
      Solemnly dedicate this house to thee,
    And mindful of the favour with which thou, O Henry, hast blessed us,
      Invoke the greatest blessings on thy rule.

The following fragmentary notices of the persons represented in the
picture, will be found of some interest.

The first figure to the left is Thomas Alsop; he was the King’s
Apothecary, and Henry VIII, by his will, left him 100 marks.

Next to him is Dr. William Butts, one of the King’s physicians,
ever famous for his memorable interference with the King on behalf
of Archbishop Cranmer in 1544, when the Roman Catholic party in the
Council endeavoured to procure Cranmer’s committal to the Tower. A
full account of this incident will be found in Strype’s Memorials of
Cranmer (Oxford Ed., 1812, pp. 177-181), and Shakespeare in his play of
Henry VIII (act v., sc. 2) has also graphically described it. Cranmer’s
Secretary, aware of Butts’ great influence with the King, sent for the
Doctor, and acquainted him with the slight which had been put upon the
Archbishop by keeping him standing in the ante-room of the Council
Chamber among lacqueys and servingmen, upon which Butts immediately
repaired to the King, and said:--

      “I’ll show your Grace the strangest sight,
      The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury:
      Who holds his State at door, ’mongst pursuivants,
      Pages and foot boys.”

whereupon Henry replies,--

      “Ha! ’tis he indeed!
      Is this the honour they do one another?
      ’Tis well there’s one above them. Yet, I had thought
      They had parted so much honesty among ‘em
      (At least good manners) as not thus to suffer
      A man of his place and so near our favour,
      To dance attendance on their lordships’ pleasures,
      And at the door too, like a post with packets,
      By Holy Mary! Butts, there’s knavery.
      Let them alone, and drawn the curtain close:
      We shall hear more anon.”

Henry spoke his mind so freely to the Council, that they one and all
shook hands with the Archbishop, and, as Strype says, “Never more durst
any man spurn him during King Henry’s life.”

Dr. Butts must have had the best practice of any man of his time; there
are several references to him among the State papers at the Record
Office, of which the following are a few examples, and indicate that
his patients were the aristocracy of the day.

  25th May, 1524. Among the funeral expenses of Sir Thomas Lovell,
  K.G., is this item:--“To John Hewson, riding to Cambridge, to fetch
  Dr. Buttes when my master was sick, 4_s._ 8_d._”

  28th April, 1525. The Duke of Norfolk, writing to Cardinal Wolsey,
  says that last night at 7 o’clock the Lord Marney was “drawyng the
  draghts of deth, and Mr. Butts determyned he shuld not lyve after 5
  owrys” (hours).

  14th October, 1525. A warrant was signed by Wolsey, directed to Sir
  Andrew Windsor, for delivery to Dr. Butts, who had been appointed
  physician to my lady Princess, of a livery in blue and green, in
  damask for himself, and in cloth for his two servants.

  17th May, 1528. In a letter from the Duke of Norfolk to Wolsey, the
  Duke says that Mr. Butts had come to him from the King, without whose
  aid he thought that he should not have recovered from his sickness.

  23rd June, 1528. In a letter from Brian Tuke (to Cardinal Wolsey) he
  speaks of an infection which had been much about of late, and how the
  King told him that Mistress Ann Boleyn and my lord Rochford both have
  had it; what jeopardy they have been in, by the turning in of the
  sweat before the time; of the endeavour of Mr. Buttes who hath been
  with them in his return; and finally of their perfect recovery.

  19th January, 1530. A letter from De Augustinis, written from the
  palace at Esher, to Cromwell, desires that Dr. Butts or Dr. Walter
  Cromer may be sent to the Cardinal and requesting that Balthazar the
  physician, may be spoken to, to obtain some leeches; no time was
  to be lost and the doctors were to bring with them some vomitive
  electuary.

Dr. Butts was a personal friend of Henry’s, who, in 1537, granted him
the manor and advowson of Thornage, in Norfolk. He died 17th November,
1545, and lies buried in Fulham Church, where there is (or was) a
monument to his memory.

Next to Butts, and immediately to the King’s right, is Dr. John
Chambre; he was physician to and a great favorite of Henry’s, holding
several clerical preferments as well. He was a Fellow and Warden of
Merton College, Oxon, where he was admitted Doctor of Physic, 29th
October, 1531. In the list of persons to whom Wolsey, in 1526, assigned
lodgings at the King’s house, when they should repair thither, occurs
the name of Dr. Chambre. There is also a catalogue of the King’s new
year’s gifts, in 1528, by which it appears that the Doctor had a piece
of plate weighing 24-3/8 ozs., at the same time the Cardinal’s gift was
40-1/4 ozs., and that of the Archbishop 31 ozs.

In Brian Tuke’s letter (23rd June, 1528), before referred to, he tells
Wolsey that when he called on the King with his letters, he found him
in “secret communication with his physician, Mr. Chambre, in a tower,
where he sometimes sups apart.”

Dr. Chambre was Dean of St. Stephen’s Chapel, Westminster, Canon of
Windsor, Archdeacon of Bedford, Prebendary of Comb and Harnham in
Salisbury Cathedral, Treasurer of Wells Cathedral, and beneficed in
Somersetshire and Yorkshire. Truly the lines had fallen unto him in
pleasant places!

He was one of the physicians in attendance on Queen Jane, at the birth
of Edward VI, and in a letter written by him to the Privy Council,
concerning the Queen’s critical state, he signs himself “priest.”
He was also in attendance on Anne Boleyn, in her confinement with
Elizabeth. His name is mentioned with that of Linacre and three others,
in the Charter to the College of Physicians, in 1518.

Sir William Compton, K.G., in 1522, nominated Dr. Chambre one of his
executors, in conjunction with the Bishop of Exeter, and Sir Henry
Marney, Lord Privy Seal.

Dr. Chambre built a “very curious cloyster,” in St. Stephen’s Chapel,
which cost him 11,000 marks, and he gave the canons of that chapel some
lands. He died in 1549.

On the King’s left is, first, Thomas Vicary (sometimes Vicars and
Vyccary), Master of the Barbers in 1530, and of the Barber-Surgeons
in 1541, 1546, 1548 and 1557. He was a man of great eminence in his
profession, having been Surgeon to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and
Serjeant-Surgeon to Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth. He was
the author of “The Profitable Treatise of Anatomy” in “The Englishman’s
Treasure, with the true Anatomie of Man’s Body.” An account of Vicary
will be found in D’Arcy Power, pp. 102, etc., and several particulars
relating to his connection with St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, are
recorded in a paper by Dr. Norman Moore (Hospital Reports, vol. xviii,
pp. 333-358); see also Dr. Furnivall’s exhaustive account (Early
English Text Society).

Next comes Sir John Ayleff (Aylif, Aylyff, etc.). He was Master of the
Barbers in 1538, and Surgeon to the King, with whom he was doubtless on
terms of friendship, as Henry bequeathed him 100 marks. Ayleff treated
Henry for fistula and cured him, at Brinkworth in Wilts, for which
the King bestowed upon him a great estate there in gratification. He
subsequently became a Merchant of Blackwell Hall, Sheriff of London in
1548, and Alderman of Bridge Without in 1550.

17th July, 1550. In the Repertories of the Court of Aldermen is a
Record that the Court of the Barber-Surgeons gave their assent to the
Translation of Sir John from theirs to the Grocers’ Company, of which
Company he was crowned Upper Warden 9th June, 1556.

Sir John Ayleff was buried 20th October, 1556, in the Church of St.
Michael Bassishaw, where there was formerly a marble tomb with this
inscription thereon--

    In Chirurgery brought up in youth,
    A Knight here lyeth dead;
    A Knight and eke a Surgeon such
    As England seld hath bred.
    For which so soveraigne Gift of God
    Wherein he did excell,
    King Henry VIII call’d him to Court,
    Who lov’d him dearly well.
    God gave the Gift, the King gave Goods,
    The Gift of God t’enhance;
    Where God and such a Prince do joyne,
    Such Man hath happy Chance.
    King Edward for his service sake,
    Bade him rise up a Knight,
    A name of Praise and ever since
    He, Sir John Ailiffe hight,
    Right Worshipful, in name and charge
    In London lived he than,
    In Blackwell Hall the merchant chiefe
    First Sheriffe, then Alderman.
    The Hospitals bewaile his death
    The Orphan children mone,
    The chiefe Erector being dead
    And Benefactor gone.
    Dame Isabel who lived with him,
    His faithful Wife and Mate,
    With him (as dearest after death)
    Doth not her Knight forsake
    The Knight the 24[79] of October.
    Yeelded up his breath,
    And she soon after followed
    To live with him in death.

    [79] Probably a mistake for 14th.

  19 April, 1558. My lady Aylyff gave a fyne table cloth of damaske
  worcke to sr̃ve for the uppermost table in the hawle the w{ch} of her
  jentyllness she gave frely unto this hawle.

John Ayleff (son of the Knight) was admitted to the freedom of the
Barber-Surgeons, 3rd June, 1552.

Next to Sir John Ayleff, is Nicholas Simpson, concerning whom nothing
is known to me, but that he was “King’s Barber,” and Master of the
Barbers in 1537.

Edmund Harman, “King’s Barber,” follows next; he was admitted to the
freedom in 1530, and served Master in 1540. Henry VIII bequeathed him
200 marks, and he was one of the attesting witnesses to the King’s
will. There are several references to him among the State Papers and
Household Ordinances. His dignified bearing and expression in the
picture are very striking.

James Monforde (or Mumford), “King’s Surgeon,” is next; he was Upper
Warden in 1540 and again in 1543, but never served as Master. He gave
the Company their silver hammer, still used by the Masters in presiding
at Courts.

Then comes John Pen (Penn or Penne), “King’s Barber,” and Groom of
the Privy Chamber; he was admitted to the freedom in 1527 and was
Master 1539. He married Lucy, daughter and heiress of Edmond Chevall,
of Coddicote, Herts, by whom he had a good estate and seven children
(_vide_ Harl. Soc. Pub. xxii., 82 & 116).

In Liber Niger Domus Regis (Harl. MS. 642) among the orders made for
the regulation of the Household of Henry VIII was one, that none but
fifteen persons whose names are specified should be allowed to enter
the Privy Chamber, and one of these is John Penne.

The following quaint regulation, concerning the King’s Barber, is to be
found in the same MS.--

  Item. It is alsoe ordeyned that the Kingꝭ Barbor shalbe daylie by
  the Kingꝭ upriseinge readdye and attendant in the Kingꝭ Privye
  Chamber there haveinge in reddynesse his Water Basons Knyvesꝭ Combes
  scissourꝭ and such other stuffe as to his Roome doth appertaine for
  trymminge and dressinge of the Kingꝭ heade and bearde. And that the
  sayd Barbour take a speciall regarde to the pure and cleane keepinge
  of his owne p’son and apparrell useinge himselfe allwayes honestlye
  in his conversationne withoute resortinge to the Companye of vile
  personnes or of misguided woemen in avoydeinge such daunger as by
  that meanes hee might doe unto the Kingꝭ most Royall person not
  fayling thus to doe uppon payne of looseinge his Roome and farther
  punnishement at the Kingꝭ pleasure.

In this MS. is also to be found an earlier order, of the time of Edward
IV touching the King’s Barber, which is curious, as indicating that
Saturday night was then (as still it is with many) “tub night” with the
King; and we may also infer from the expression “_if_ it please the
King to cleanse his head, legs or feet,” that it was _not_ a fixed rule
for him to do so _every_ Saturday night.

  A BARBOUR for the Kingis most highe and drad p’son to be taken
  in this Court, after that he standeth in degree gentleman yoman
  or groome. It hath bin much accustomed to one or two well knowne
  officers of the Ewrie in housold Daily of such as bene for the monthe
  Sergeant or othir. Also we finde how this hath bene used amonge by a
  weele betrusted yoman of chambre ffor lacke of cunning of these other
  men. It is accustomed that a knight of the Chambre or elles squire of
  the bodie or both be p’sent every time when the Kinge wolle shave.
  This Barbour shall have every satterday night if it please the Kinge
  to cleanse his head leggꝭ or feete and for his shaveing two lovis[80]
  one pitcher wine. And the usher of chambre ought to testifie if this
  be necessary dispensed or not.

  [80] Loaves.

It is said that the portrait of Pen was greatly admired by Sir Robert
Peel, who frequently came to the Hall to look at it, and who is
reported to have offered the Company £2,000 for the head, if it might
be cut from the picture, he undertaking to make good the damage! He is
also alleged to have said at one of his visits, that he should like to
sleep on the table at the Hall, so that the first thing he would see
on waking in the morning might be Pen’s head. Had Sir Robert known the
legend[81] of the _table_ he would perhaps have suggested a different
bed. Henry VIII left, by his Will, 100 marks to Pen.

[81] Said to have been part of the dissecting table!

Concerning the next man, Nicholas Alcocke, nothing is known beyond
that he was Surgeon to Edward VI, and was admitted to the freedom in
1523. He was doubtless a member of the Court, though he never served as
Warden.

The last on the front row is Richard Ferris (or Ferrers), Master in
1563 and Serjeant-Surgeon to Elizabeth. Like others of his brethren, he
also benefited under Henry’s will, to the extent of 100 marks, and was
one of the King’s Surgeons.

In the back row are seven figures, but of these the names of only two
survive, viz., William Tylley, Upper Warden 1546, and Christopher Samon
(Salmon, Sammond), admitted to the freedom in 1528, and Master in 1553.
By Domestic Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 5, p. 690, it appears that one
Christopher Samon was living in Lombard Street in 1532: this might be
the same man.

29 August, 1668. Dear old Samuel Pepys visited us this day, and thus
records his intentions and opinion concerning the picture--

  And at noon comes by appointment Harris to dine with me: and after
  dinner he and I to Chyrurgeons Hall, where they are building it new,
  very fine; and there to see their theatre, which stood all the fire,
  and which was our business, their great picture of Holben’s, thinking
  to have bought it by the help of Mr. Pierce,[82] for a little
  money: I did think to give £200 for it, it being said to be worth
  £1,000; but it is so spoiled that I have no mind to it, and is not a
  pleasant, though a good picture.

  [82] James Pierce (or Pearse) Surgeon to Charles II and to the Duke
  of York. Master in 1675

James I seems to have entertained a high opinion of this picture, and
borrowed it of us to be copied: his letter applying for it is preserved
at the Hall, and is as follows.

  JAMES R.

  Trustie and welbeloved Wee greete you well. Where we are informed
  of a Table of painting in yo{r} Hall wherein is the Picture of o{r}
  Predecesso{r} of famous memorie K. Henry the 8{th}, together with
  diverse of yo{r} Companie, w{ch} being both like him, and well done,
  Wee are desirous to have copyed. Wherfore o{r} pleasure is that
  you presently deliver it unto this bearer Our Welbeloved Servant
  S{r} Lionell Cranfield Knight, One of Our Maisters of Requests,
  whome Wee have commaunded to receave it of you and to see it w{th}
  all expedition copied and redelivered safely; and so Wee bid you
  farewell. Given at Our Court at Newmarket the 13{th} day of Januarie
  1617.[83]

  [83] _i.e._, 1617/8.

The Court of course agreed to lend the picture, though doubtless with
some misgivings; contrary however to the practice of the time when
money was “lent” to the King, it found its way back to the Hall.

In 1627, Charles I, a more suspicious borrower than his father, had it
to Whitehall, but here again we fortunately had it returned.

The Royal College of Surgeons possess some Cartoons, from which, it has
been said, this picture was painted; this is, however, very doubtful.
Some particulars as to these Cartoons may be seen in Mr. D’Arcy Power’s
book, p. 96.

In 1734 the Company agreed with Mr. Bernard Baron for him to engrave
the picture for 150 guineas, and several details relating thereto are
recorded in the Minutes. It was published in 1736, and is a faithful
reproduction, much sought after by collectors. Baron has however copied
the picture, exactly as he saw it on to the copperplate, so that when
the impressions were struck off, everything was reversed. His original
study, a red crayon, beautifully executed, is preserved in the Court
Room, and the copperplate is still used, each Assistant on his election
being presented with a copy of the engraving. The Company also possess
a rather rough proof before letters.

The print is dedicated to the Earl of Burlington, with a Latin
inscription, of which the following is a translation.

“To the Most Noble Lord Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington and Cork,
&c., Knight of the Most Illustrious Order of the Garter. For the
restoration, with the greatest liberality, at his own costs, of the
Anatomical Theatre built a hundred years before, with the greatest
skill, by the very celebrated Architect Inigo Jones, and decayed by
lapse of time. This painting of Holbein representing the granting of a
Charter given with his own hand by Henry VIII, King of England, &c., to
the Society of Surgeons in London and preserved in their Hall, is by
the Society of Surgeons of London humbly dedicated.”

This inscription, written at a time when the relations between the
Barbers and the Surgeons of the Company were becoming strained, was
evidently drawn by a Surgeon, who coolly ignored the Barbers throughout.

A very good pen and ink drawing of the picture was made by Austin
Travers Young (aged 16) in 1883, and presented by him to the Company,
for which he received the thanks of the Court.

1537. In “Chapter House Book” B. 1. (at the Record Office) is a list
of the freemen of the several Companies of London at this date, which
gives the names of 2,468 freemen in 39 Companies (an average of about
63 to each). The Barbers outstripped in numbers all the others, having
a roll of 185 members; next to them came the Skinners with 151, then
the Haberdashers with 120, so on down to the Bowyers, who mustered
but 19. The premier Company, the Mercers, numbered but 55, whilst the
ancient Weavers had only 30 members.

The following is the list of our freemen, the first twenty-six being
members of the Court, and Nicholas Symson, Master that year.

The forty-two names following the Court and ending at John Awcetter
were Liverymen, the remaining hundred and seventeen being Yeomanry.

1543. A few years previously the King had set the example of
wearing his hair and beard short, and now the City seems to have
discountenanced long beards, as I find the following in _Letter Book Q.
87_. (10th July, 35 Henry viij.)

1544 and 1545. In _Repertory XI_ (at Guildhall) ff. 73{B.,} 176,
187{B.,} 229{B.,} 232 and 234 are various records relating to the vexed
question of the Barber-Surgeons going on inquests, bearing armour and
serving as constables, from all which offices they claimed exemption
under their Charters and Act of Parliament.

By the earlier entry, it seems that the Wardens were warned to appear
before the Court of Aldermen to shew cause why they refused to pass
upon inquests, etc.; then came a petition from the Company praying
to be discharged of all offices save the Inquest of Wardmote once a
year; this does not appear to have satisfied the Authorities, and the
Company were directed to draw up further Articles to be submitted
to the Court of Aldermen. Great pressure was no doubt put upon the
Barber-Surgeons, the result being that they abandoned most of the
privileges of exemption which they had claimed, and submitted a Bill
of Articles, which was finally approved, and entered of record on fo.
234. A copy of this lengthy document is at the Hall, and from it it
appears that on the 22nd October, 1545, the Company appeared before
the Court of Aldermen as “humble Besechers” to be shorn of their
privileges, the ground of their petition being “That forasmoche as
some grudge and displeasure is lately sith the unyon and conjunction
of their said ffelowshippes in to one entyre Company growen conteyned
and taken against them and their said ffelowship, by dyverse of theire
neighbours being citezeins of this citie, as they be, by reason that
they your said suppliauntꝭ” are discharged by their Charters and Act
of Parliament from bearing offices, etc., “that other the Cittzeins
of this citie are ellygible and lyable unto, ffor the whiche grudge
and displeasure your besechers are not a little sorye. ffor the
playne declarac͠on thereof and for the eschewyng advoyding and utter
extinguysshement of the said grudge and displeasure from hensforwarde,”
they are content that it shall be ordained that they shall go upon
all Wardmote Inquests, but not upon any inquests between party and
party (_i.e._, sit as jurymen in civil actions); that all freemen
of the Company not practising Surgery shall be contributory to all
assessments, serve as Constables and keep watches in their turn as
other citizens, but that all Surgeons shall be free from bearing
armour, etc.

Notwithstanding this compromise, entered in the City books, it seems
in course of time to have been overlooked, and, as has been previously
remarked, the exemption of _all_ freemen of the Company from juries,
etc., has been claimed and allowed down to quite recent days.

[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE PAGE OF FIRST MINUTE BOOK, 1557.]

1550. The first of our Court Minute Books which has been preserved,
commences in the 4{th} Edward VI, and bears this title,

  ~Orders and Awardes~ made ordered and awarded within the tyme of
  Maister George Geen Thomas Johnson Thomas Stocdall and Mathew Johnson
  Maister and Wardeins of the Company and fellowship of BARBORS
  SURGEONS of London for one hole yere begynnyng the xxvj{th} day of
  Auguste in the fowerthe yere of the reigne of our Sovereigne Lorde
  Kynge Edward the Syxte with thassent and consent of the Assistaunces
  of the same Companye as hereafter ensuethe.

From this and the succeeding Minute Books, the following extracts are
principally taken as illustrative of the Company’s History from this
period:

1556. At the end of the first book is a very long memorandum written
and signed by Thomas Knot, Master, to the effect that on the 26th
March, 1556, he made humble suit to the Lord Mayor, Sir Will{m.}
Garrett and the Aldermen, in the name of the Company, for the exemption
of the Company from finding or setting forth any soldiers or men of war
at any time thereafter, when it might be that the Citizens of London
should be required to do so, either by sea or land, “fforasmoche as
the same Company are alwayes at every such tyme and tymes very sore
burdened and chardged otherwise hereafter expressed, that is to saye,
They are comaunded and bounden to prepare and fynde so manye Surgeons
and so many other men attendinge upon them at every tyme and tymes
that it shall fortune the King” to send out soldiers by sea or land,
and “the same Company doe alwayes prepare fynde and send furthe for
every one houndreth of suche Souldyers one Surgeon and a man attending
upon him.” Upon which representations the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
were pleased to grant to the Company, that on future occasions when
the like requisitions might “fortune to be layed or appointed to
or upon theym, that then they in every suche case upon their gentle
suyte and request made unto the Lorde Mayor and courte of Aldermen for
the tyme beinge for and concernynge their sayd dischardge for and in
consyderac͠on of the causes above remembered, shalbe as gentelye and
charytably holpen eased and releaved in that behalf as the wayte and
ymportaunce of the burden that the Cytie at every suche tyme shalbe
chardged w{th} all will reasonablye permytt and suffer.”

The memorandum then proceeds to state that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
advised the Master to cause a remembrance of the above (being only a
promise by word of mouth) to be entered and recorded in the Book of
Ordinances of the Company, which was done.

1555. In Henry Machyn’s Diary for this year, is the following reference
to a Romish procession, winding up with a dinner at Barbers’ Hall.

  The xxvij day of May was the Clarkes prossessyon from Yerdhall[95]
  college, and ther was a goodly masse to be hard, and evere clarke
  havyng a cope and garland, with C.[96] stremers borne, and the
  whettes[97] a playng round Chepe, and so to Ledynhall unto Sant
  Albro[98] chyrche, and ther thay putt off ther gayre, and ther was
  the blessyd sacrament borne with torche-lyght abowt, and from thens

King and Queen seated on the throne, and the border containing various
heraldic badges; the seal unfortunately is damaged.

It is noticeable in this Charter that the confirmation is to the
Governors of the “Barbers,” and not “Barber-Surgeons,” although the
latter was then the legal style of the Company, but probably this was
another clerical error.

1560. This year (6th January) the Company obtained an Inspeximus
Charter from Elizabeth, still preserved at the Hall; it has a title in
much the same style as the preceding charter, but the seal is very much
damaged.

1567. Elizabeth inaugurated the first State Lottery in England, as a
means of providing money, and a very peremptory mandate was directed
by the Lord Mayor to the various City Companies, commanding them to
adventure therein.

1st February, 1568. The Barber-Surgeons put in 40{s.} for the “use,
profet and benefyt of the hall,” but did not draw a prize, and indeed
none of the Companies reaped any advantage by the speculation, the
Lottery being simply a trap into which they were ordered to walk.

The proposal for this Lottery was as follows:--

  A verie rich Lotterie Generall without any Blancks contayning a
  great No. of good prices, as well of redy money, as of Plate &
  certaine sorts of marchaundizes having been valued & prised by the
  commaundement of the Queenes most excellent Majestie by men expert
  & skilfull and the same Lotterie is erected by hir majesties order,
  to the entent that such Commoditie as may chaunce to arise thereof,
  after the charges borne, may be converted towards the reparation of
  the Havens and strength of the Realme, & towardes such other publique
  good workes. The No. of lots shall be foure hundreth thousand, and no
  more: and every lot shall be the summe of tenne shillings sterling
  onely, and no more.

Stow says that this Lottery was commenced to be drawn on the 11th
January, 1569, at the West Door of St. Paul’s, and continued drawing
day and night until the 6th May following.

It was a common practice of the Companies to put in their money under
mottoes, and some curious ones are recorded, many being composed with a
quaint sarcasm on the probability of prizes being obtained.

Herbert (Hist. of the Twelve Livery Companies) gives some interesting
particulars of the State Lotteries, and quotes a motto used by the
Merchant Taylors which pretty clearly indicates their opinion of the
business;

      One byrde in the hande is worth two in the wood,
      If we get the great lot, it will do us good.

Some of the prizes were ridiculously small, _e.g._, 1_s._ 2_d._, 2_s._
1_d._, etc., and great dissatisfaction was expressed at the principal
prizes remaining unpaid to the winners.

1573. The Company received a precept from the Lord Mayor for a “loan”
of money to make provision of wheat for the City, and the same was by
the Court ordered to be complied with. This “corn custom” is very fully
treated of by Herbert, and was virtually a tax upon the companies, who
were each rated and compelled to find a certain proportion of corn to
be stored by the City, and sold at such times as when, there being a
scarcity, the markets would otherwise rise, were it not for the immense
stock kept by the City. This custom survived for many years under
certain modifications; as we shall see hereafter, our Company built a
granary in 1633, and stored their own corn.

The precept above referred to was as follows--

  Forasmuche as all comon polecye requyreth the prevenc͠on of
  extremities, and consideringe as you knowe the urgent and present
  necessitie, and the lacke of provision of wheate and other grayne for
  furniture of this so great and populous citie, of the want whereof
  the queenes ma{tie} and her most honorable coñsell are not ignorant;
  but havinge spˀcial regard to the same, are not a lytle offended
  and displeased, with some grefe that there bene no better pˀvision
  heretofore made, and that presentlie the cittie shoulde be no better
  stored, by reson wherof the prices of corne and grayne is now muche
  dearer in this cittie than in any other parte of this realme, have
  not only at sundrye times and gentle meanes, but also w{th} some
  terror, as welle in the Starre-chamber as in other places afore the
  counsell, given us admonicion that the same her ma{ties} cittie and
  chamber may not be unfurnished for lacke of good pˀvision. And we,
  as our duties is, havinge great care and especial consideracion of
  the same, and pˀcevynge by order of the harvest past, and the unkynd
  season of the yeare, sith that the prices of corne is verry likely
  to encrease and be advanced to a greater and higher price than yet
  is, have thought good and verrye necessarye for the avoyding of
  greater inconvenyences, to make immediate pˀvision of a great masse
  and quantity of wheate and other grayne, as well w{th}in the realme
  as beyond the seas for the provision aforesaid, w{ch} cannot be done
  w{th}out a great some of money presentlie to be defrayed, w{ch} is
  not to be levyed but by the good assestens of you and others, good
  coustomers and cittezens of this cittie; have therefore assessed
  your Company of Barber Surgeons at the some of[114]        which is
  agreed upon by acte of coˀen counsell, w{ch} some of        we do
  not only require you, but also streaghtle charge and comande you,
  immediatelie upon the recept hereof, calling your companye together
  in your comon hall, you do forthw{th} tax, levy, and gather of the
  welthiest and most able persones of the same the sum aforesaid,

The next entry would seem to indicate some contemplated State
interference with the Company’s property, and the answer was probably
not in exact accordance with the truth, for on the 28 May, 1576, a
precept in the Queen’s name, having been received, calling upon the
Master and Wardens to return to the Guildhall an account of the revenue
of their lands, and of their goods, “the answere was that the true
revenewe of the landes was xx{ti} markes whereof the most pˀte went
forthe and is disbursed in peñcons, and that we had no goods.”

1578. A precept was received as follows,

In pursuance of this precept a levy was made upon ninety freemen,
who contributed £19 17_s._ 11_d._ (in sums ranging from 1{s} to 6{s}
8{d}) and upon ten “foreins” who paid in all £3. The Expenses of the
soldiers, and their arms, powder, etc., are all set out in detail (see
Appendix D).

1585. It was agreed “that o{r} Companie by reason of the often and
earnest preceptes from the Lorde maior to move unto some liberall
puttinge in of monie into the Lottery for Armo{r}, that o{r} Companie
should put in x{li} yf that might satisfie for all the Companie viz{t}
the Clothinge vj{li} xiij{s} iiij{d} and the yeomanry v m’kes.”

29th September, 1586. The Lord Mayor had issued sundry precepts to the
Company for the “buyeinge of certein goune powder amountinge in waight
to of one Mr. Henry Dale Hab’dassher at the price of x{d} le ɫi. and
yt was agreed the saide powder should be bought and that Mr. Swaldell
[Master, 1593] should go to chuyse it, and he to have the same powder
for viij{d} the pounde.”

10th March, 1589. It was ordered that the gunpowder directed by another
precept to be provided by the Company, should be bought and that it
should be kept “in the Armorie howse in convenient place for feare of
daunger of ffier.”

29th March, 1596. It was ordered that £40 “ship money” should be “lent”
by the Company to the City, which is the earliest mention of this
obnoxious tax in our books.

8th August, 1596. “Yt was agreed that the som̃e of £xxx{ti} shalbe lent
unto the Cytty for the payenge of Souldiers wages and other charges
diffrayed about the Spanishe voyage.” This was an Expedition of certain
ships (furnished by the City) under the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter
Raleigh “to annoye the King of Spaine.” The English then sacked and
burned Cadiz, burnt the Spanish navy, and on their return home, says
Stow, “great triumph was made at London for their good successe.”

18th August, 1598. At this Court came a precept from the Lord Mayor,
commanding the Company in Her Majesty’s name to “lend” £100 to the
Queen for six months, for suppressing rebels in Ireland. The demand
was, as usual, of a most peremptory nature, and the Court ordered £100
to be paid to the Treasurers appointed by the City.

6th August, 1599. A precept came from the Lord Mayor in the Queen’s
name, commanding the Master and Wardens to deliver to the freemen the
Company’s armour in “suche order as it maye be, in safetye readie for
her Maiesties service,” whereupon the Master took for his own use “one
muskett fflaske and tuche boxe one headepeece and one rest.” Eleven
other members of the Company had armour delivered out to them, as “one
caliver fflaske and tuche boxe, sworde and dager girdle and hangers and
headepeece.”

1599. A precept was received on 11th November, commanding the Company
to be in attendance on the Queen in her progress from Chelsea to
Westminster, which is not only curious for the quaintness of its
description of the persons who were to be appointed, but affords a
glimpse at the magnificence of Royal processions three hundred years
ago.

In pursuance of the above precept the Master with seven other Members
of the Court were appointed to attend, and eight freemen were nominated
as torchbearers.

1600. The fee simple of three houses in Monkwell Street was this year
purchased by the Company of William Fyninge for £112!

11th November, 1600. In obedience to a precept it was ordered that
twelve members of the Court “well mounted on horseback and apparrelled
in all poynts accordingely,” together with twelve freemen “to wayte
uppon them w{th} evˀy one twoe staffe torches in his hande,” were
to meet at the Hall on the following Thursday (13th November) and
to ride with the Lord Mayor to Chelsea to conduct the Queen to
Westminster. This procession is thus referred to in Stow’s Annals; “On
the thirteenth of November 1600, her Maiestie being most honourablie
attended on, by the most honourable Prelates, and Nobles, and Judges
of the Realme, was received neere unto Chelsey, by the Lord Maior of
London, with his brethren the Aldermen all in Scarlet, besides to the
number of five hundred citizens, in coates of velvet, and chaines
of gold, on horesbacke, every of them having two staffe torches to
attende on them: And they all waited on her, to her royall Pallace at
Westminster.”

9th November, 1602. Various members of the Company “were appoynted to
ryde w{th} the M{r} to meete her Ma{tie} on Saterdaie next” at Chelsea.

9th April, 1603. A precept was received commanding the Company to
contribute £12 10_s._ 0_d._ towards the cost of the reception of James
I by the City, whereupon an assessment was made upon the freemen for
the same, and the Masters made “choyce of sixe pˀsonable menn for
Wiflers to attend the Livˀye of this Companye when his Ma{tie} goeth to
be crowned.”

20th April, 1603. The following precept requiring the Company to assist
in the reception of the King “in greater number and more statelie and
sumtiows shewe then hath bene at any time heretofore within the memory
of man in the like case pˀformed,” will be read with interest;

9th August, 1603. James soon attempted to borrow (as he termed it) of
the Companies. “Where a pˀcept was directed to õr M{rs.} for the lone
of money to the Kinge, wee are to answer that wee have none.”

Perhaps this reply sufficed on this occasion.

22nd October, 1603. London was this year visited with a great Plague,
and in consequence there was no Lord Mayor’s Show.

  This xxij{th} of October 1603.

7th February, 1604. The Court having considered the many abuses
“comited against the weale of this Company” decided to apply for an
Act of Parliament which should confer upon them extended powers, and
appointed a Committee for the purpose, with the Recorder and Mr.
Wilbraham as counsel.

20th October, 1604. From an entry of this date, it seems that it had
been decided to apply for a fresh Charter, instead of an Act of
Parliament, and a summary of the clauses (twenty-seven in number)
which it was desired to have embodied therein is set out in full. As
the Charter was obtained, it is unnecessary to give these suggested
clauses here (they may be seen in Mr. D’Arcy Power’s book, p. 361). The
16th one is, however, curious enough, declaring the “openinge searinge
and imbalmeinge of the dead corpes to be pˀply belongeinge to the
science of Barbery and Surgery, And the same intruded into by Butchers
Taylors Smythes Chaundlors and others of macanicall trades unskillfull
in Barbery or Surgery, And unseemely and unchristian lyke defaceinge
disfiguringe and dismembringe the dead Corpes, And so that by theire
unskillfull searinge and imbalmeinge, the corpes corrupteth and groweth
pˀntlie contagious and ofensive to the place and pˀsons approachinge.”

30th January, 1605. The Charter of James I is of this date, but not
now in our possession; there are, however, two copies of it at the
Hall, one of which was made in a vellum book in 1658. It was in Latin
of prodigious length; but the following are the clauses as I make them
out, and will suffice for this work.

1. It grants to the Company of Barber-Surgeons that it shall be ruled
by four Masters or Governors and twenty-six Assistants.

2. Power given to the Masters to make lawful assemblies, to keep Courts
in their Common Hall, and therein to consult, counsel and decree
touching their Statutes, Laws and Ordinances, for the good rule, state
and government of the Company.

3. Power to make laws, etc., for the government of the Masters or
Governors, and of all and singular persons using the mysteries of
Barbery or Surgery within the City of London, the liberties and suburbs
thereof.

4. Power to punish offenders by penalties, fines, and imprisonments.

5. Fines to be levied by distress by the officers of the Company.

6. Nomination of John Laycock as Master, and of the three Wardens.

7. The present Masters to continue in office until the Monday next
before the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, and until the election
of new Masters.

8. The present Masters and Assistants to continue on the Court for
life, unless removed for misbehaviour or other good cause.

9. Upon the death or dismissal of an Assistant, the vacancy to be
filled up by the Court.

10. Assistants to be sworn on admission.

11. The Masters, or the more part of them, to choose twelve persons of
the mystery (six whereof to be expert Surgeons), which twelve were to
be the Electors to choose the new Masters or Governors on the Monday
next before the feast of St. Bartholomew.

12. Of the four Masters, two to be Surgeons.

13. The Masters elected to be sworn to the due execution of their
offices.

14. Any member elected a Governor, to be ever after an Assistant.

15. If a Governor be dismissed for misconduct, another to be chosen in
his place in the form provided.

16. The twelve Electors to be sworn.

17. Power of search, oversight, reformation, government, and
correction, as well of free as of foreign professors of Barbery and
Surgery in London and its suburbs.

18. Power of entry into Shops of Barbers and Surgeons.

19. Power to oversee and approve or condemn plasters, ointments,
instruments, etc.

20. Power to examine Barbers and Surgeons.

21. Power to prohibit ignorant persons, or such as shall wilfully
refuse to be examined, from practising.

22. Power to admit skilful persons to practise Surgery.

23. Power to reject and destroy all noxious or improper medicines,
ointments, instruments, etc.

24. The Masters finding on their search any impostors, ignorant
persons, or refusers to be examined, the same to be bound to their good
behaviour.

25. No butcher, tailor, waxchandler or other persons, to cut, dissect
or embalm any dead body, but the same to be done by members of the
Company approved and appointed by the Masters or Governors of the
Barber-Surgeons.

26. The Masters or Governors and admitted Surgeons, to be discharged
from Watch, Ward, Inquests or Juries, and the office of Constable, and
from assessments for the same.

27. Power to purchase lands, etc.

28. Ratification of the old liberties and franchises of the
Barber-Surgeons, and of their lands.

29. All Mayors, Bailiffs, etc., to be aiding and assisting the Masters
or Governors in the execution of their offices.

Christian IV, King of Denmark, brother-in-law of James, paid a visit
to England in 1606, and was sumptuously entertained. In accordance
with the custom of the time, there was a grand pageant and procession
in the City, in which all the Companies took part, and the following
precept for the same was received by us;--

                             BY THE MAIOR.

  TO THE M{R} & WARDENS OF THE }
    COMPANY OF BARBOR SURGEONS }

  FFOR the bewtefieinge of the streetꝭ and lanes w{th}in this Cittie
  against the passage of the Kingꝭ most excellent mat{ie} and the
  Kinge of Denmarke their nobilitie and trayne from the Tower through
  this Cittie. THEIS are in his Ma{t}ꝭ name straightlie to charge and
  command you that all delayes & excuses sett aparte you have and
  provide yo{r} rayles in a readines for the livery of yo{r} company
  to stand in and to be sett up in the streetꝭ against wednesday the
  xxx{th} day of July at the furthest. AND likewise that yo{r} railes
  against that tyme be hanged with blew azure cloth & garnished w{th}
  Banners & streamers in the most bewtifull manner that may be, as
  formerlie in like solempnities hath bin accustomed. AND that you
  likewise have and provide sixe whifflers at the least to evˀy score
  of yo{r} livery well apparrelled w{th} white staves in their handes
  to stand with their backꝭ to the Common railes over against your
  yo{r} Companies railes for the better and quieter ordering of the
  streetꝭ through which his ma{tie} shall passe. AND hereof faile you

                                                       SEBRIGHTE.

Three days after the receipt of the above, came another precept
demanding £5 from the Barber-Surgeons towards the City’s expenses to be
incurred about the Pageant.

The two Kings landed at the Tower, from Greenwich, on the 31st July, on
which day the City gave itself up to the gayest doings and rejoicings.
A curious and interesting description of the pageant is to be found
in a rare tract by H. R., 1606, preserved at Guildhall Library. Howes
also gives an entertaining account of the proceedings, and relates how
the King of Denmark “seriously observed the unimaginable number of
gallant Ladies, beauteous virgins, and other delicate Dames filling the
Windowes of every houss with kinde aspect saluting” him as he passed
by. He also tells us of the melodious harmony, the Latin speech, the
pastoral device, and the fountains which ran with wine, etc.

It seems that on this great occasion one of the Marshalls had
endeavoured to take our Company “down a peg” in order of precedence.
This was, however, successfully resisted, and the Clerk proudly records
the following in the Minutes on the same day:

  MEMORAND: that the Kingꝭ ma{tie} w{th} the Kinge of Denmarke & the
  Prince of Wales came through this Cittie from wardes the Tower of
  London attended uppon with the Lordes and gentry of this Land on the
  last day of this instant moneth of July Att which tyme M{r.} ffoxe
  beinge one of the Comittees for placeinge of the Companies standingꝭ
  would have displaced us But by the Lord maiors order wee were placed
  in the seaventeenth place accordinge as wee ought to be placed.

1606. Notwithstanding the new charter granted in the previous year,
the Court found itself unable to regulate the practice of Barbery and
Surgery without an extended set of By-Laws, which were now obtained and
are still preserved at the Hall. They are in English, on eight large
skins of parchment, beautifully engrossed with a handsomely illuminated
title, the initial ~T~ containing the Barber-Surgeons’ arms, and
distributed over the heading are the arms of the Master and Wardens in
1606, viz.: John Peck, Edward Rodes, William Fynynge and John Fenton.

[Illustration]

The By-Laws are allowed by Thomas Lord Ellesmere, Lord Chancellor;
Thomas Earl of Dorset, Lord Treasurer; and Sir John Popham, Lord
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; who send “greeting in our Lord God
Everlasting,” and enact Ordinances of such fearful length, that to
a layman it passes comprehension how the draughtsman could have kept
his head clear whilst he travelled through such a sea of prolixity,
and, to a great extent useless, repetition. If the Chancellor and
his colleagues troubled themselves to read through and understand
the document to which they have appended their seals, they must have
uttered very sensible sounds of relief when they came to the sealing;
the recapitulation of the mere heads of this extraordinary production,
will probably be found wearisome to the reader, viz{t}:

1. Recital of an Act of Parliament, 24th Feby., 19 Henry VII.

2. Oath of a freeman.

3. Oath of the Masters or Governors.

13. Masters neglecting the day of Election, the distribution of
Ferbras’ alms, or the payment of rents, to forfeit £5.

14. No great Election dinner to be kept without the consent of a Court

15. The allowance for a great dinner to be 20 marks, and for a small

24. And on refusal to pay such fines, to be dismissed out of the Court
of Assistants and out of the Livery.

25. If the Electors choose such refuser to further place, before he
have paid his fine, each Elector to forfeit 40{s.}

26. Every person chosen into the Livery to pay £5 if he have not served
as Warden of the Yeomanry, and if otherwise then 40{s.}

27. Election of two Stewards of the Mayor’s feast, and two Stewards of

  8th September, 1606. This daie it is ordered that the M{rs} shall pay
  v{li} to M{r} Michaell the Lord Cheif Justices man for his paynes in
  penninge of o{r} ordynaunces.

  And M{r.} ffenton and M{r.} Jenkins are to joyne with the M{rs} of
  this Company in the same buildinge.

This Court Room was built within the circular Bulwark at the west end
of the old Livery Hall, from which it was shut off by a screen wall
or partition; many years later this screen was removed, and the whole
thrown into one large apartment, and used as the Livery Hall.

  21st January, 1608. The pˀnt M{rs} are this daye authorized to
  furnishe the newe Roome in the Bulwark w{th} cloth of Arras or
  tapestry or w{th} waynscot as they shall think fittest at the chardge
  of this howse, and the Chimney peece & wyndowes to be waynscotted.

1608. The Colony of Virginia (so named from the Virgin Queen Elizabeth,
in whose reign it was discovered) was in an unsatisfactory condition
by reason of its scanty population, want of enterprise and other
causes; whereupon the Council of Virginia endeavouring the prosperity
of the Colony, sent a letter to the Lord Mayor propounding a scheme of
emigration and colonisation to be undertaken by the City, which should
ease the Metropolis “of a swarme of unnecessarie inmates,” make the
fortunes of the emigrants (and of the “undertakers”) and benefit the
Colony. This letter is so interesting that no apology is necessary for
reproducing it here.

  WHEREAS the lords of his Ma{tes} councill, commissioners for the
  Subsedie, desirous to ease the cittie and suburbs of a swarme of
  unnecessarie inmates as a continuall cause of dearth and famine,
  and the verie origenall of all plagues almost that happen in this
  kingdome, have advised yo{r} lordshippe and yo{r} brethren, in
  an ease of state, to make some voluntarie contribuc͠on for their
  remove into the plantation of Virginia, w{ch} we understand you
  all seemed to like as an action pleasing to God and happie for
  this com̃onwealth; We the councell and companie of this ho{ble}
  plantation, willing to yelde unto your lop̃p and them all good
  satisfac͠on, have entered into consultac͠on w{th} o{r}selves, what
  may be everie mans chg̃es, and what of everie private familie, w{ch}
  we send herew{th} at large, not as a thing w{ch} we would exact from
  you, but that you may see, as in a true glasse, the true chg̃e,
  w{ch} we wholly commend unto yo{r} grave wisdoms, both for the somme
  and man{r} of leavie; onlie give us leave thus farre to enforme you
  that we give no bills of adventure for a lesse some than 12{li}
  10{s.} ps̃uminge it wont be an infinite trouble now, and confusion
  in the retribuc͠on, but if your lop̃ make any seasment, or raise any
  voluntarie contribuc͠on out of the best disposed and most able of
  the companies, we are willing to give o{r} bills of adventure to the
  m{r} and wardens, to the general use and behoof of that companie, yf
  by wards, to the good of that ward, or otherwise as it shall please
  you and your brethren out of y{r} better experience to direct. And
  if the inmate called before you and enjoyned to remove shall alledge
  that he hath no place to remove unto, but must lie in the streats,
  and being offerd this journey shall demand what shalbe their pˀsent
  maintenance, what their future hopes, yt may please you to lett them
  know that for the pˀsent they shall have meat, drink, and clothing,
  w{th} an house, orchard, and garden for the meanest familie, and
  a possession of lands to them and their posteritie, one hundreth
  acres for everie man’s pˀson that hath a head or a body able to
  endure labour, as much for his wife, and as much for his child that
  is of yeres to do sˀvice to the colonie, w{th} further pˀticular
  reward according to theire pˀticuler meritt and desert; and yf yo{r}
  lordshipp and yo{r} brethren shalbe pleased to put in any private
  adventure for yo{r} selves in pˀticuler, you shalbe sure to receive
  according to your pˀporc͠on of the adventure, equall pˀts w{th} us
  adventurers from the beginning, both of the comodities returned or
  land to be divided; and because you shall see (being aldermen of so
  famous a cittie) we beare you due respect, we are contented, having
  but one badge of grace and favor from his Ma{tie}, to participate
  w{th} you therein, and to make as many of you as will adventure
  50{li.} or more, fellow councellors from the first day w{th} us who
  have spent double and treble as much as is required, abidden the
  hazard of three sevˀall discoveries, w{th} much care and diligence,
  and many days adventure, and as yo{r} deputies, and yo{r} assistants,
  in yo{r} private wards, so shall as many of them as will adventure
  but 25{li.} present money, be made pˀties of this companie and
  assistants of this councell; and thus as an action concerning God
  and the advancement of religion, the present ease, future hon{r} and
  safety of this kingdome, the strength of o{r} navie, the visible
  hope of a great and rich trade, w{th} many secrete blessings not
  yet discovered, we commend the cause to the wisdome and zeale of
  yo{r} selfe and yo{r} brethren and you, and it, and us, to the holie
  pˀtection of the Almightie.

The City took up the scheme heartily, a large sum was subscribed and
a great number of emigrants crossed the water. The Barber-Surgeons
invested £25, but never received anything for it again.

  23rd March, 1609. This daye it is ordered that the pˀnt M{rs} shall
  advent{r} xxv{li.} uppon a Bill of Exchange for the plantac͠on of
  Virginia, of the stock of this howse.

6th January, 1609. In obedience to a precept from the Lord Mayor, £10
was paid to the Chamberlain, towards the construction of a Garner for
the use of the City.

25th May, 1610. A precept came from the Lord Mayor calling upon the
Company “to be readie in yo{r} bardge well and richlie sett forthe
before vii of the clocke in the morning” on the 31st January, to go to
Chelsea to meet the eldest son of James I, on which occasion he was to
go from Richmond to Whitehall to be created Prince of Wales; whereupon
the following minute is recorded:--

  AT this Court a precept beinge sent from my lord Maior unto this
  Company w{ch} beinge at this Court read, the effect whereof was that
  our Company on Thursdaie next shalbe reddie to attend my Lord Maior
  in their barge for the honor of this Citie in the enterteynement of
  the high & mightie prince at Chelsey. It was ordered that none of
  the Company shold be warned for this service but onely those w{ch}
  ware of the Assistaunce of the Clotheinge to goe in the Barge, the
  reason thereof is that a barge cold not be gotten large enough to
  carry the whole lyvery.

1611. In this year came a precept from the Lord Mayor, by authority of
the King, complaining of “the abuse growing by excesse and straunge
fashions of apparell, used by manye apprentises, and by the inordynate
pryde of mayde servaunts and women servaunts in their excesse of
apparell and follye in varietie of newe fashions, and to admonish
them to have a due and speciall care to see a spedye reformac͠on had
in everye one of their servaunts.” What effect this had upon the
apprentices and servants of the Barber-Surgeons we are not told, but
doubtless they were properly admonished.

1st July, 1614. A precept was received to the effect that the King had
determined to borrow £100,000 of the City, and that the Barber-Surgeons
were assessed at £600 towards this loan, which they were to lend, or
which they were coolly informed they could compound for, by an absolute
fine of £30! As the Court well knew that they would never again see a
halfpenny of the £600 if lent, they quickly and wisely determined to
pay the £30.

Profiting by past experience, the next extracts show that the Court
proceeded warily in the matter of “adventuring” in the State Lottery.

  29th April, 1614. Att this Court the M{r} propounding how they had
  receaved Letters from the Lordꝭ of the privy Councell and from
  the lord Maior thereby exhorting & intreating them to call their
  assistauntes together and to admonishe the genˀall body to be
  adventurers in the great lottery w{ch} is comyng forth, Whereupon the
  same lrẽs being considered on at this Court, it is thought fitt and
  ordered that the M{rs} shall att their pleasures call together the
  body of the Company, and they being gathered together, to admonish &
  pˀswade them to be adventerers in the same Lottery.

17th October, 1614. The Court having collected a sum of money for the
Lottery, it was ordered that it should not be paid to the Treasurer,
Sir Thos. Smith, until the Company shall be “assured” by a Bill of
Adventure under seal “for their adventure unto virgynia, as also that
it shalbe published in print certeynelie when the lotterey shalbe
drawen.”

The College of Physicians had been for many years very jealous as
to the Barber-Surgeons trespassing on their preserves, and as far
back as 12th November, 1595, wrote a long letter to their “verie
loving freends” the Master and Wardens, cautioning the members of
the Company against practising physic, and stating that no few of
them were culpable in the matter, but that the College had hitherto
forborne to molest or punish them; the letter continues, “but for that
we now see by daily experience that upon our lenetie and sufferance
this inconvenience more and more increaseth, insomuch that both in
credit and otherwise, it seemeth to touch us more neere than well
can be indured; We have therefore thought it good to put you in mynd
thereof, and therewithal earnestly and freendlie to request you, that
among yourselves some such discreet order may be taken heerin, that
the like offence hereafter maie not be committed by them or any of
theirs. Wherein if we shall perceave you as ready to fulfil our honest
request, as we are willing to maintain good amytie and concord with
you and your Companie, we wilbe very glad thereof and geve you thanks
therefore. If not, then as we are fully minded to defend our privileges
and to deal with the particular offendors therein, as order of law
and our ordinances in that behalf requireth; so we trust the body of
your Societie will not be offended therewith. And so we bid you most
hartelie farewell.”

The above letter is taken from Dr. Goodall’s History of the College of
Physicians. Dr. Goodall gives several instances of Barber-Surgeons
and Apothecaries being fined or imprisoned for practising physic; and,
indeed, there seems to have been a strife waging between the College
and the Company for a long period.

1617. The Physicians in 15 James I obtained a Charter confirming their
Charter of 10 Henry viij, with several additional privileges and
clauses in restraint of the privileges of the Barber-Surgeons, who
thereupon petitioned the King that that Charter might not be confirmed
by Act of Parliament, as the Physicians were desirous that it should
be. The King on 4th February, 1620, ordered that the petitioners should
be left to seek any lawful remedy either in Parliament or otherwise,
as they might be advised, and accordingly on 23rd April, 1624, they
presented a petition to the House of Commons, who ordered that the
Physicians’ Patent should be brought into the Committee of Grievances,
and both parties heard by Counsel, the consequence of which was that
the Physicians proceeded no further with their Bill.

1632. Later on the Physicians endeavoured again to obtain a supremacy
over the Barber-Surgeons, and on 13th June, 1632, procured an Order in
Council which made it incumbent upon Surgeons in certain serious and
specified cases of Surgery, to call in a “learned Physitian,” and to
enforce this order they procured the Attorney General to exhibit a Bill
in the Star Chamber in which the obnoxious clause was inserted, but on
a Petition of the Barber-Surgeons complaining of the injury that would
thereby accrue not only to themselves, but to the public, the King,
by an Order of Court dated 22nd July, 1635, directed the clause to be
struck out.

After the Restoration, the Physicians again endeavoured to procure
an Act of Parliament confirming their Charter, whereupon the
Barber-Surgeons claimed to have a clause inserted in the Act in the
nature of a proviso that nothing therein contained should be construed
to the prejudice of their privileges, and again the Physicians seem
to have been checkmated, for they allowed their proposed Act to fall
through.

Kings’ Barbers and Kings’ Surgeons seem to have secured substantial
benefits from their official positions, as the following notices (from
Domestic State Papers at the Record Office) testify.

25th August, 1625. There is a letter of this date from Sir James
Fullerton to Secretary Conway, intimating that it is His Majesty’s
pleasure to grant to Michael Andrews (Master 1635 and King’s Surgeon) a
pension of £150 per annum for life.

17th December, 1625. And at this date is a grant to Thomas Caldwell
(Master 1627 and King’s Barber).

  A graunt to Thomas Caldwell esq{r} his Mat{s} servant of ye som̃e of
  one thousand poundes To be received as well out of the remainder of
  three hundred pounds due to his Ma{tie} by Richard Harbin sometime
  Collecto{r} of his Ma{t}ꝭ greenwax before his accesse to the Crowne
  and out of the arrerages of grenewax money then due unto his Ma{ty.}
  As also out of the other grenewax moneys now accrewing to his Ma{tie}
  not being in farme. And is granted to him as of his Ma{ts} bounty
  in lieu of 800{li} formerly graunted unto him by his Ma{ty} of
  w{ch} he received no benefitt. Subscrˀ by Mr. Attorney Genˀall upon
  significac͠on of his Ma{t}ꝭ pleasuere by the Lord Trẽr.

In addition to stray grants like the above, the perquisites and fees
attaching to the Office of King’s Barber were very lucrative, and Mr.
Caldwell must have done exceedingly well out of the following stroke of
business.

  January, 1626. Whereas his Ma{tie} hath bene pleased to appoint Mr.
  Thomas Caldwell his Ma{ts} servant and Barber to make provisions of
  all such necessaries as are to be used at the Ceremony of Bathing the
  Kn{ts} of the Bath at this his Ma{ties} Coronac͠on to be holden on
  the 2{d} day of February next at Westm{r} as to his place by auntient
  custome belongeth I do therefore will and require all such whome it
  may concearne to take notice thereof hereby for permitting him to
  doe and performe all such services as hath bene accustomed in that
  behalfe & for delivering such necessaries in kynd or allowance of
  money to the valeu thereof as shalbe by him required for the same
  according to the auntient custome heretofore used therein. The number
  of the said Kn{ts} for whome such provisions are to be made being 80,
  by his Ma{tie} appointed to receave that degree.

                                                     ARUNDELL & SURREY.

Mr. Caldwell does not appear to have left his widow well provided for,
as we read under date 10th July, 1643:

  Upon the distressed Petic͠on of Widdow Thamar Caldwall late Wife of
  M{r} Thomas Caldwall deceased there is given to her of the gift of
  this House v{li.}

1624 and 1625. In the minutes of this period are constant notices of
the “visitation,” and of “the contagious tyme.” The Plague raged with
great severity in London in 1625, and it is said that over 40,000
died of it in the year. The Company appear to have been very liberal
in their gifts of money to any who had the least claim upon them, the
relief being frequently stated to have been given by “reason of the
hardnes of the tymes.”

  11th April, 1625. This daye the pˀcept for provision of corne sent
  unto o{r} Companie by the lord Maio{r} of london was here read in
  Courte, And this Courte is fullie resolved that the present M{rs} doe
  give unto the Lord Maio{r} and returne him this answeare that the
  Companie is provided of their proportion of corne and more they are
  not able to provide or receive into their charge.

1628. This year the Company were compelled to “lend” the King £360,
which they with great difficulty raised, the greater part being
borrowed at interest to enable them to do so. They also paid £30
towards a “present” (?) of £5,000 given by the City to the Palsgrave
(Frederick, Prince Elector Palatine, son-in-law of James I).

15th August, 1629. On this day was sealed the Company’s new Charter
from Charles I. It is in Latin on five large skins of parchment with
the Great Seal of England pendant. There is a portrait of the King
with a stiletto beard in the initial letter, and an ornamental heading
along the top of the first skin. This Charter ratifies that of James I,
directs that public lectures on Surgery shall be given, and confirms
and somewhat varies the old regulations for the governance of the
practitioners of that science.

22nd October, 1629. The Company evidently began now to kick at the
numerous demands made upon its purse by the authorities, for a precept
coming from the Lord Mayor demanding £12 10_s._ contribution towards
a pageant, it was ordered that it be not paid until the Court was
satisfied that it could be legally demanded, and enquiry made as to
whether or no other Companies had paid similar contributions.

1632. The fabric of old St. Paul’s being in a lamentable state
of decay, the celebrated Archbishop Laud wrote a letter to the
Barber-Surgeons asking a contribution towards its repair. Ever ready
to assist in good works, the Company cheerfully devoted a very
considerable sum towards that object, notwithstanding the comparative
poverty to which they had been reduced (in consequence of the grievous
impositions made upon them by the authorities in the shape of forced
loans and other unconstitutional demands). Moreover, they recorded
their benefaction, in a delightfully expressed minute, which will be
found at the end of the following letter.

  9th April, 1632. The letter written by William Lord Bishopp of London
  and directed to this Court concerneing our contribuc͠on towardꝭ the
  repaire of St Paulls Church in London being now much ruined was here
  in Court reade, the teno{r} whereof is as followeth, vidz{t}

      To the right worp{ll} my very worthy ffreindꝭ the Maister Wardeins
      and Assistantꝭ of the Companie of Barbar surgions London, theis

  S. in xp̃o.[117] After my verie hartie comendac͠ons, you cannot but
  take notice of his Ma{t}ꝭ most hon{ble} and pious intention for
  the Repaire of the decayes of S{t} Pawles Church here in London,
  being the Mother Church of this Citty and Diocess, and the greate
  Cathedrall of this Kingdome. A greate dishono{r} it is not onely to
  this Citty but to the whole State to see that Auncient and goodly
  Pyle of building soe decayed as it is, but it will be a farr greater
  if care should not be taken to prevent the fall of it into ruin, And
  it would be noe lesse disgrace to Religion happily established in
  this Kingdome, if it should have soe litle power over the mindes of
  men as not to prevaile with them to keepe those eminent places of
  Gods service in due and decent repaire which their fforefathers buylt
  in tymes by their owne confession not soe full of the knowledge of
  gods truth as this present age is. I am not ignorant how many worthy
  workes have bene done of late in and about this Citty towardꝭ the
  building and repayring of Churches which makes me hope that every
  mans purse will open to this greate and necessary worke (according to
  Gods blessinge upon him) soe much tending to the service of God and
  the hono{r} of this nation. The generall body of the Cittye have done
  verie worthily in their bounty allready as alsoe the lord Maio{r}
  Aldermen and Sheriffes severally for their owne pˀsons. Theis are
  therefore accordinge to their examples hartily to pray and desire
  you the Maister Wardeins and other Assistants of the worthy Company
  of Barbar Surgions to contribute out of y{e} publicke Stock, to the
  worke aforesaid what you out of y{r} Charitye and devotion shall
  thinke fitt, and to pay the Summe resolved on by you into the Chamber
  of London at or before our Lady Day next, praying you that I may
  receave by any servant of yo{r} Companye a note what the Summe is
  which you resolve to give. And for this Charity of yo{rs} whatsoever
  it shall prove to be, I shall not onely give you harty thankes, but
  be as ready to serve you and every of you, as you are to serve God
  and his Church. Soe not doubting of yo{r} love and forwardnes to this
  greate worke, I leave you to the grace of God, and shall soe rest

  [117] Health in Christ.

                                Yo{r} very loving ffreind

                                                        GUIL: LONDON:

  London house, January 30. 1632.


  And thereupon this Court deepely considering the contentꝭ of that
  letter together with the pˀnte ruines and dilapidac͠ons of the said
  Church, and as faithfull and charitable members obliged largely to
  contribute to soe pious and religious a worke Doe nowe order that out
  of the stock and revenew of this house there shalbe paid into the
  Chamber of london towardꝭ the said repaire x{li} pˀntely and x{li}
  yearely for nine yeares followeing to make it upp compleate a C{li}
  as of the free guift of this house. And if att any tyme hereafter the
  worke doe cease that then our payementꝭ to cease likewise.

1633. This year the Company built a granary at the Hall, for the store
of Corn.

12th July, 1633. A new set of By-Laws was framed and allowed by
the proper authorities. These are extant on twelve great skins of
parchment, more wordy and of greater length than those of 4th James I!
They are, however, very similar to those, with technical alterations
and amendments here and there, and provision is made for Lectures on
Surgery, demonstrations of anatomy, and for the better Examination of
Surgeons. Clause 19 provides that any freemen of the mystery who shall
use any arts, trades or sciences other than Surgery “shall be accepted,
reputed, adjudged and taken for Barbars.” Empirics and impostors were
to be rigorously dealt with, and the Court was to have supervision
over _all_ Navy Surgeons, their chests, medicines and instruments. No
Barbers or Surgeons were to be impressed for the Navy without license
of the Court, and numerous regulations were made for the government of
the Company.

The document is signed by Richard Earl of Portland, Lord Treasurer; Sir
Thomas Richardson and Sir Robert Heath, the Lords Chief Justices; the
seals of the first two are still pendant, but that of Sir Robert Heath
is missing.

1636. Spurred into further action for the advancement of the science
of Surgery, which their extended powers under the new By-Laws had
conferred upon them, the Company determined upon building a Theatre
for the delivery of Lectures, and for anatomical purposes, etc. This
they set about in 1636, employing the great Inigo Jones as their
Architect, who about this period also designed and carried out the
present beautiful Court Room or Parlour, one of the best proportioned
and prettiest rooms in London.

[Illustration: INTERIOR OF COURT ROOM.]

  11th February, 1636. Upon the moc͠on of o{r} M{r} to this Court
  concerneing the want of a publique Theater for Anatomycall exercises
  and Sceletons and a lesser roome for private discections, This Court
  doth order that if the M{rs} or Governo{rs} upon their petic͠on to
  the Lord Maio{r} and Aldrẽn they have the bullwarke & long stripp of
  ground lieing betwixt the gould smiths tenement & clothw: tenemtꝭ
  & london wall at the one end & the Companies hall & pˀlor & london
  wall at the other end, by purchase in fee farme or a long lease from
  the Cittie, that then a Theater to the largenes of the upper ground
  betwixt the goldsmithes tenem̃t & the clothworkers tenem{t} on the
  one side & london wall on the other side shalbe be ovally built for
  the Wor̃p[118] and comiditie of this Companie at the Charge of this
  house.

  [118] Worship.

The piece of ground on which it was proposed to erect the Theatre
was then on lease to the Company from the City. The Lease was dated
29th March, 7 Charles I (1631), and made between the Mayor, &c., of
London, of the one part and the Masters, &c., of the Barber-Surgeons,
of the other part. In consideration of £20 paid by the Company the
City leased to them lwark and the houses Roomes and buildings therein
or thereupon made or erected, And all that ground or garden plott
with thappurtenñces scituat lyinge and beinge in the parish of St
Olave in Silver Street in the Citie of London next unto the Wall of
the same Citie there of the one side, and the landes of the saide
Maisters or Governors and others on the other side late in the tenure
or occupac͠on of the right honoro{ble} Henry late Lord Wyndsor
deceased or of his assignes and now in the tenure or occupac͠on of
the said Maisters,” etc., from the feast of the Annunciation, 1631,
for forty-one years at a rent of £3. The lease contained the usual
covenants of a repairing lease, as also one “that neither they the
saide Masters or Governors their successors nor assigns shall or will
att any time or times during the said Terme suffer any Inmate or
Inmates to dwell in any part of the premises afore demised.”

5th May, 1636. There is an Indenture of Lease of this date made
between the Mayor, &c., of London, and the Masters, &c., of the
Barber-Surgeons, which after reciting the last mentioned lease
proceeds: “And whereas the said Maisters or Governors of the Misterie
and Comonaltie of Barbars and Surgians of London for the better
enhableing of them in the Arte of Surgerie Doe intend to erect and
build a decent Roome or Theatre on part of the premisses for the
keeping therein A learned and constant Lecture in the Theorie and
practiqʒ partꝭ of Surgerie As also to pˀforme their publique operac͠ons
of Anatomies and other exercises thereunto belonging, Which will be
verie chargeable to them Wherein the said Maior and Cominaltie and
Citizens are desirous and willinge to aide and further the saide
Maisters or Governors in the setting forward of soe necessarie
and comendable a worke tendinge to the generall good of the whole
kingdome,” wherefore the Mayor, &c., leased the said premises to the
Company for a further term of 200 years upon the expiry of the lease
then running, at the same rent of £3 per annum, the Lessees covenanting
to build the Theatre within seven years.

  16th May, 1636. Upon o{r} M{rs} report to this Court that the Lord
  Maio{r} & Aldrẽn have freely graunted to this house a new lease of CC
  yeares comenceing from the expirac͠on of o{r} lease now in being It
  is ordered with the generall consent of the whole Court here present
  that the Theater shalbe proceeded in and built according to the
  plotts drawne by his Ma{t}ꝭ Surveigher.

  3rd August, 1636. It is ordered by this Court that the Companies
  Armes with Helmett Crest supporters and mantlings shalbe sett up in
  Portland Stone under the Cantilaver does of the Theater being over
  the Windowe next the Granarye.

  Alsoe the mottoe viz{t.} SPECIOSUM HOC THEATRUM ANATOMICUM ERECTÑ

A plan of the Theatre is preserved in a collection of the works of
Inigo Jones, at Worcester College, Oxford, and a short description of
it is found in Hatton’s New View of London, 1708. The curiosities in
the Barber-Surgeons’ museum of those days will excite a smile when
compared with the collection now at Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Hatton says
that the Theatre was built in “an elliptical form, and commodiously
fitted up with four degrees of seats of cedar wood, and adorned with
the figures of the seven liberal sciences, and the twelve signs of
the zodiac. Also containing the skeleton of an ostrich, put up by Dr.
Hobbs, 1682, with a busto of King Charles I. Two humane skins on the
wood frames, of a man and a woman, in imitation of Adam and Eve, put
up in 1645; a mummy skull, given by Mr. Loveday, 1655. The sceleton of
Atherton with copper joints (he was executed) given by Mr. Knowles in
1693. The figure of a man flead, where all the muscles appear in due
place and proportion, done after the life. The sceletons of Cambery
Bess and Country Tom (as they then call them), 1638; and three other
sceletons of humane bodies.”

Hogarth has, in ghastly style depicted the dissection of a criminal
in this Theatre, in which the skeletons above referred to are seen in
niches in the wall.

[Illustration: ESTATE IN MONKWELL STREET]

The plan of the Company’s Estate, has been kindly supplied for this
work by Mr. Charles John Shoppee, as surveyed by him in 1869, previous
to the demolition of the old Livery Hall, Kitchen, etc. The Theatre had
been pulled down in 1784, and houses erected on its site; the Theatre
is, however, shewn upon this plan, as being more interesting than the
houses which supplanted it. In 1636 the Company commenced the erection
of the Livery Hall and present Court Room, the work being carried out
from the designs and under the superintendence of the celebrated Inigo
Jones, the Livery Hall was, however, burnt in 1666, and that shown upon
the plan is the one which was erected after the Great Fire.

5th September, 1636. The Plague was again abroad in London, and the
Court, for fear of infection by meeting together, resolved as follows:

  In regard of the now greate visitac͠on of the plague This Court
  doth deferre the Courts for the daye of Rules the Vew daye & other
  publique Courts till it shall please God to cease the Sicknes.

23rd September, 1636. The Lord Mayor having requested the Company to
nominate “twoe Surgians to take care of those that were infected with
the plague in this Cittie & liberties,” the Court thought that two was
a wholly insufficient number and nominated six Surgeons to be presented
to the Court of Aldermen.

2nd October, 1636. £5 was ordered to be paid in to the Chamber of
London towards the relief of the poor, stricken with the Plague.

30th March, 1637. The Company were assessed to pay £10 “ship money,”
whereupon an order was made that they should forbear to pay it, and
a Committee appointed to wait on the Court of Aldermen to petition
against the assessment. The application was, however, unsuccessful, as
by an Order of Court, 29th March, 1638, the money was directed to be
paid.

8th November, 1638. The Court of Aldermen having assessed the Company
to furnish 80 quarters of corn in lieu of 60 as heretofore provided,
it was resolved to petition against it. This would be a very important
matter to the Company as the assessments for all public purposes were
made upon the City Companies _pro rata_ with their corn quarterages,
and if the 80 quarters were allowed to stand, it would raise all the
future assessments 33 per cent. The result however, of the protest does
not appear in the minutes.

28th October, 1640. On receipt of a precept from the Lord Mayor, it was
ordered that three barrels of Gunpowder should be bought and stored.

1640. The Company unwillingly agreed to lend the King £400, and were
put to great inconvenience in raising the money, which was required by
Charles for his campaign in Scotland.

After several skirmishes with the Scots, the English Army was at length
disbanded, and the King went himself to Scotland to negotiate the
difference which had arisen by his attempted interference in Church
matters in that Kingdom; he returned to London in November, 1641, and
the following minute refers to the preparations made by our Company to
meet him.

  22nd November, 1641. Upon reading the Lord Maiors precepts for the
  Companyes enterteyning the King upon his returne from Scotland It is
  ordered that the Ma{r} and Wardens, Mr. Serjeant Clowes, Mr. Richard
  Wateson, Mr. Woodall, Mr. Powell, Mr. Burgin, Mr. Heath, Mr. Henry
  Wateson, Mr. Bignall, Mr. Dye, Mr. Arris, Henry Boone, and Thomas
  Turner, shalbe attendant on Twesday next well mounted on Horseback in
  plush or Velvett with Chaines of Gold, and that John Perkins shall
  beare the Pendon with our Coate of Armes on Horseback and that these
  18 ffree men shalbe Decently cladd in the Companyes Colours of White
  and Greene, each of them with a greene flatt Cap with a white Ribbon
  about it, a greene Cassock and Drawers of the same Stuffe Whiffler
  like laced with a white Lace a white ribaning and a greene Ribbin
  athwart theire Brests, and each of them a Truncheon in theire hands
  in the forenoone, and in the aftˀnoone each of them 2 Torches, and
  these 18 to attend perticulerly one of them to each of the Horsemen,
  viz{t.}

(Then follows a list of the freemen chosen.)

The “Riding out” on this occasion must have been a magnificent sight,
if all of the Companies spent proportionately to the outlay of ours,
which was no less than £39 17_s._ 10_d._ upon decorations, etc., for
those taking part in the procession. Strype informs us that--

  The Lord Mayor on horesback wearing a gown of crimson velvet & a
  collar of SS, and attended by his suite, rode in the front of the
  procession to meet the King. Then followed the Aldermen in scarlet
  gowns and the City council and chief officers in black gowns. Upon
  reaching Moorfields, there waited in a readiness to attend his
  Lordship and the service, about five hundred horsemen selected out
  of the Liveries of the several Companies, being Masters, Wardens,
  and prime men of each Company in velvet or plush coats and suits,
  with chains of gold, being well horsed and gallantly furnished, every
  Company having a horseman in the front carrying a pendant with that
  Company’s arms to which he did belong (for distinction sake), and a
  footman to attend each horseman of the Livery with truncheons and
  torches as before, both horsemen with the pendants and footmen being
  suited cap-a-pee with the Company’s colours on which they waited.
  There were also fourteen Trumpeters, with trumpets, banners and
  scarfs, who were placed two between every hundred of the horse, and
  four at the head of the troop. The procession moved on to Kingsland,
  where the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and the Companies awaited the Kings
  approach, while the Sheriffs attended by seventy-two men in Scarlet
  Cloaks trimmed with silver lace (the colours of the City) with
  javelins and feathers and four trumpeters, rode as far as Stamford
  Hill, and there met their Majesties and escorted them to Kingsland.

  His Majesty was accompanied by the Queen, the Prince, the Duke of
  York, the Princess Mary and the Prince Elector Palatine, and after
  receiving an address, the Royal party joined the civic procession
  to London, entering it at Moorgate, and proceeded through London
  Wall, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill and Cheapside, to the banquet
  at Guildhall, amidst the City Companies in their formalities and
  stands on each side of the streets, the City conduits running with a
  diversity of wines.

1643. The relations between the King and the City having become
estranged in the fearful distractions of these times, Charles
endeavoured to conciliate the citizens with a message, which was
publicly read at Guildhall on the 13th January, and later on he sent
a circular letter to the Masters of the several Companies requiring
them to call their freemen and apprentices together, to read to them a
copy of a letter which he had sent to the City on the 17th January. The
Court of the Barber-Surgeons met on Tuesday, 24th inst., and cautiously
record that they would have summoned their freemen for the next day,
but that it was a fast day and that in the interim an order had come
from the Committee of Safety that the letter, etc., should not be read.

  24th January, 1643. The Kings Letter sent to the M{rs} & Wardens of
  this Company was read in Court and the printed Letter in it and the
  Cittyes Petic͠on and his Ma{ties} gracious answer unto it. And but
  that the morrow was fast day being the last Wednesday in this Moneth
  the ffreemen and apprentices of this Company could not be summoned
  to appeare then, it should have bin read. Soe that in the Interim
  an Order of Comand from the Lords and Comõns was directed to this
  Company to countermaund the said Letters in these words,

  Die Martis 24{to} Januarii, 164-2/3. At the Comittee of Lords and
  Comõns for the safety of the Kingdome.

  Whereas there are divers Letters pretended to be sent by his Ma{tie}
  to the M{rs} and Wardens of the severall Halls in the city of London
  with Two litle Bookes therein closed the one intituled The humble
  Petic͠on of the Maior, Aldermen and Comõns of the City of London
  to his Ma{tie.} And the other intituled his Ma{ties} Letter and
  declarac͠on to the Sheriffes and City of London Dated the 17{th}
  of January, which evidently tendeth to sedition and setting of the
  whole State in a Combustion. These are therefore strictly to charge
  & comand the M{rs} and Wardens of every Hall in the City to whome
  the said Letters and Bookes inclosed shalbe directed to forbeare to
  publish or open any of them till both the Houses of Parliament shall
  give further order therein. And the M{rs} and Wardens of every Hall
  are required to bring the said Letters with the Messengers thereof to
  this Comittee which they will take to be an Argument of theire good
  Affection to the Parliament

      W. Say & Seale   Ed: Howard   Jo: Evelin    Jo: Pym
      Antho: Nicoll.

  17th January, 1644. It is ordered that in respect of the greate
  troubles and distractions of these times there shalbe noe publique
  Anatomy this yeare dissected.

1644. The Company seem to have become greatly impoverished by the
venture in Ireland, the rebuilding of their premises, and the forced
loans to the King and the Parliament. In a certificate given by the
Master and Wardens (5th September, 1644) to be produced in a suit in
which they were defendants, they state that their debts are £3,000,
and that they can get no return of any of the money lent for public
purposes, or even the interest of it.

If the Stuarts acted in an unconstitutional manner in their oppressive
demands upon the Companies, the Roundheads were as bad, with just this
difference, that, with all their pretensions to purity, piety and
high-mindedness, they did not hesitate to practise actual dishonesty
in their _modus operandi_ of squeezing the Companies, as the following
painful incident from our books testifies:--The Company had borrowed
from Mr. Richard Wateson, one of the Assistants, £1,200 upon sealed
bonds, for the express purpose of meeting the demands which had been
made upon them by the King and Parliament from time to time. Mr.
Wateson having been declared a “Papist and Delinquent,” his property
was seized, and the Bonds of the Barber-Surgeons, found in his strong
chest, were taken to the Committee for Gloucester and Hereford, sitting
at Grocers’ Hall. These worthies, in conjunction with the Committee
for Sequestrations, came down upon the Company and demanded payment
of the £1,200 for which they had given their bonds to their brother,
Mr. Wateson. The Court deeming this a monstrous piece of injustice,
hesitated to comply, whereupon the Committees threatened to seize
the Company’s entire estate; and then the Court resolved to petition
Parliament, but the House not sitting for some time the petition could
not be prosecuted, and the Committee being urgent, the Company most
reluctantly agreed to pay down £400 and to have the bonds cancelled.
Although these shameful terms were definitely agreed upon, the
Committees a few days later broke faith, demanding £400 cash and the
Company’s bond for another £100, to which the Company, like the lamb
with the wolf at its throat, _nolens volens_, consented. The iniquity
of this business was made apparent to the Committees, who were well
aware that the Company had incurred the debt to Mr. Wateson in order
to meet the previous rapacity of themselves, and yet they hesitated
not to compel the Company to submit to a further fine of £500 for
having complied with their demands in the past, besides manifesting the
dishonesty proposed by them in offering to cancel the debt due by the
Company to Mr. Wateson.

  29th April, 1645. By the power and authority to this Court given by
  severall Orders of a late Court of Assistants, this Court for and
  towards the raiseing of the 400{li} agreed to be paid in part of
  the composic͠on for Mr. Watson’s debt unto the the Comittee for the
  releife of Gloucester, &c., did pawne all the Companyes plate both
  guilt and white, weighing 1,120 oz. 1/3 or thereabouts, unto Mary
  Crosse of London Widdow for the Sum̃ of 280{li} by a Writeing of
  Bargaine and Sale this day sealed with this Companyes Com̃on Seale
  bearing date the 16{th} day of this Instant Aprill with a provisoe of
  Redempc͠on. And borrowed of Mr. George Dunn 100{li} more at Interest
  at vj{li} 10{s} pˀ annum pˀ centum for w{ch} he tooke the secureity
  of our Com̃on Seale.

A few years later on (14th September, 1648), Mr. Edward Arris presented
to the Court a letter from Mr. Wateson, wherein was intimated that he
expected the Company to repay him the money borrowed, the bonds for
which had been seized by Cromwell’s party, and for which the Company
had already compounded, whereupon we read “This Court doth declare
theire acknowledgement of a great respect and esteeme they have and
beare towards him and shalbe ready to doe him all the right they can
without prejudicing the Company”; and again on 30th April, 1650, “Mr.
Richard Wateson an ancient M{r} of this Company Doth this day desire
to know the mind of this Court concerning the 1,200{li} by him lent to
this Company and sequestred in this Company’s hands and compounded ffor
500{li} in full of principall and Interest, The matter being of great
Consequence, this Court doth take time to consider of it and to give
him an answer therein.”

What answer Mr. Wateson got, I do not know; he was held in great esteem
by the Company, and doubtless some honourable compromise was arranged.

In their negotiations with the Committees, the Company seem to have
been able to impress the Chairman favourably on certain occasions,
though there is grave reason to apprehend that this official of the
party of purity was open to a bribe, as the following minutes would
seem to indicate.

27th October, 1645. The Company having been threatened with
sequestration of their entire estate unless an assessment made upon
them was paid on Friday following, a Committee of the Court was ordered
to wait on Mr. Scawin, the Chairman of the Committee for the Army, to
beg his favourable consideration of the Company’s poor estate; the
result is seen in the next entry.

  14th September, 1648. This Court takeing notice of the greate Love
  and ffavour of Mr. Scawin Chaireman to the Comittee ffor the Army
  expressed oftentimes upon severall occasions towards our Company
  Doth thinke fitt in gratitude and accordingly doth order That the
  present Governours doe present to him a guift of the value of vj{li}
  13{s} 4{d} The quality and price of the guift is left to theire
  discretions.

1646. To relieve them of their great debts, the Company about this
period raised considerable sums by granting annuities; the following
are examples in point:--

  24th March, 1646. This day M{r} Nicholas Heath payd the sum of
  200{li} to the use of this Company and is the purchase money for an
  Annuity of 26{li} pˀ añn. for 10 yeares to himselfe and Grace his
  Wife Whereupon the Deed of Grant of the said Annuity was sealed with
  the Com̃on Seale and delivered to theire use.

  Alsoe this day M{ris} Elizabeth ffreeman payd the sum of 200{li} the
  Purchase money for the like Annuity of 26{li} pˀ añn. for 10 yeares
  and the Deed for that purpose was sealed and delivered to her.

On the 30th January, 1649, the King’s troubles were ended by his
murder, and very shortly afterwards we find this significant minute.

  19th March, 1649. This Court doth order That the Oath conteyned in
  the Rules and Ordinances of this Company be administred unto every
  ffreeman upon his admission as before, The ffirst Words which doe
  concerne allegiance to the King and his Successors only to be left
  out.

The banners of the Company bearing the late King’s arms were destroyed,
and any heraldic insignia at the Hall which contained the Royal Arms
were ordered to be defaced. We may readily believe that this was most
unwillingly done by the Court, who however, had no option in the matter.

1648-9. Fairfax had filled the City with troops, “billetting orders”
being made upon the several Companies for the reception of the soldiers
at their Halls. Herbert (Vol. I, p. 181) states that the Merchant
Taylors were fortunate enough to procure an order of exemption which
cost them £20 10_s._, and further that he believed their case to be
unique, but it seems that the Carpenters by means of “Gratuities ‘to
sevˀall men of qualitie,’” amounting to £13 2_s._ 6_d._, managed to
get free of this imposition, whilst the Barber-Surgeons procured their
immunity at a much cheaper rate, for we read in the Wardens’ accounts
of the period,

  Paid fforr the charges expended in procureing a Protecc͠on from the
  Lord General from quartering Souldiers in the hall 13{s} 3{d.}

These notices are clear indications that Cromwell and the “men of
qualitie” about him, were accustomed to take bribes.

3rd February, 1654. The City entertained Cromwell at Grocers’ Hall, and
our Company had to go out in procession to receive him, our “standing”
being in St. Paul’s Churchyard.

1660. The Barber-Surgeons contributed £96 towards a present of £10,000
given by the City to Charles II at the Restoration. No money exacted
under precept was more willingly paid than this, and indeed the
Companies generally seemed to have cheerfully contributed, delighted
to have escaped the gloom of the Commonwealth, and with a prospect
of brighter times in store. On the 5th July, the King was nobly
entertained at Guildhall, our Company taking part in the rejoicings
(see Wardens’ Accounts of this date).

1666. Our Minute Books for this period having been lost or stolen, we
unfortunately have no records of the Great Fire beyond those preserved
in the “Wardens’ Accounts” (which see), and although these are somewhat
meagre, they are highly interesting, especially those which relate to
the fortunate preservation of the great Holbein picture. It has been
stated (but without any other authority than that of gossiping Samuel
Pepys, who had a special interest in disparaging the picture) that it
was damaged in the fire, though no notice of such a mishap is known to
me, and the Accounts (which are _complete_) are significantly silent
as to anything having been spent on its restoration or cleansing,
which, had it been injured, would have been necessary; it seems to have
been taken away from the Hall by Major Brookes to a place of safety,
and subsequently brought home again by six porters.

[Illustration: OLD ENTRANCE TO BARBER-SURGEONS’ HALL.]

The Theatre, which was a detached building, as also the present Court
Room, both the works of Inigo Jones, were saved, though the Hall was
burned, entailing a great expense upon the Company in rebuilding (see
Wardens’ Accounts).

The houses 33, 34 and 35, Monkwell Street (see plan, p. 135) were
rebuilt 1671, when the gateway to the Hall Court Yard was formed and
the grotesque coat-of-arms put up over the Lintol.

When the alterations were made under the superintendence of Charles J.
Shoppee in 1869, the old lintol, corbels, tympanum, and door-head were
very carefully taken down and refixed over the present entrance to the
Hall in the Court Yard. This door-head is always an object of interest
to visitors to Barbers’ Hall; long may it continue to be so!

25th August, 1681. A short set of By-Laws was this day enacted. It
is on a single skin of parchment, and imposes penalties upon such
persons, as, being elected, should refuse to serve as Masters or
Stewards of Anatomy. It is signed by Heneage, Earl of Nottingham, Lord
Chancellor, and Sir Francis Pemberton and Sir Francis North, the two
Lords Chief Justices, all of whose seals are pendant to the document.

1684. This was indeed a troublous year for the Corporation and for
the guilds of London. Charles having interfered with the privileges
of the City by thrusting in his nominees for Sheriffs, had met with
considerable opposition from the citizens, and being assured that
this resistance would be continued and maintained by the City, he
determined to strike a blow at the root of its franchise, by getting
into his hands the Charter of the City, as also the Charters of the
several Companies. It was not difficult to procure a venal tribunal
which would be prepared to pronounce an iniquitous judgment upon any
fictitious statement submitted to it by the King. Sir Rob{t.} Sawyer,
the Attorney-General, thereupon undertook, on behalf of the Crown,
to prove that the City Charters were forfeited, and contrived the
celebrated _quo warranto_, upon which judgment was (as a matter of
course) obtained against the City, on the 12th June, 1684.

The Companies seem to have unanimously anticipated this decision, and
by so doing and by “surrendering” their Charters and liberties before
the delivery of the judgment, hoped to ensure the favour of the King.

The original of the “surrender” of the Barber-Surgeons is very neatly
engrossed on extra thick parchment, but the seal was of course removed
when it was returned to the Company. The text is as follows:--

  To all to whom these p{r}sents shall come. GOVERNO{RS} of y{e}
  MYSTERY and COĨALTIE of BARB{RS} & SURGEONS of LONDON send GREETING.

Similar forms of surrender were adopted by other Companies. I am unable
to say whether or no the King interfered with the franchises of the
Barber-Surgeons, but think not, as no record of such meddling is to be
found in our books, though, doubtless, the Court took care, remembering
the rod in pickle, to govern in accordance with the wishes of the King.

Some time in this year (1684) certain unquiet spirits, Surgeons of our
Company, got up a petition to the King, setting forth that the union of
Surgeons with Barbers hindered rather than promoted the end for which
the two bodies had been united, and praying the King to incorporate the
Surgeons a distinct and separate body. Nothing came of this application
beyond a reference (ordered by the King, 15th May, 1684) to the Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal, and the Lord Chief Justice of the King’s
Bench, who were directed to examine and report upon the petition, but
whether they ever did so or not, I don’t know.

27th February, 1685. James II, in the first year of his reign, granted
us a Charter, which is contained on seven skins of parchment, all of
which have handsomely designed head-pieces and borders, the first one
having a fine portrait of the King as well; only a fragment of the
great seal remains, and the charter itself is considerably damaged,
apparently by rats. It is in Latin, of great length, and, like others
granted to other companies at the period, is an “unreal mockery.”
The Charter recites the “Surrender,” and proceeds to grant another
charter in which, _inter alia_, the appointment of any Master, Warden,
Assistant, or Clerk should be subject to the approval of the King,
that all members of the Company should take the Oaths of Supremacy and
Allegiance, be in the Communion of the Church of England and receive
the Sacrament, and that no person who frequented a conventicle should
be eligible for the Livery.

4th April, 1687. The King having published a declaration, allowing
liberty of conscience to all his subjects, suspending and dispensing
with the penal laws and tests, and even with the Oaths of Supremacy
and Allegiance on admission into offices civil and military, numerous
addresses of thanks for this liberty were presented to the King, among
others the following one from our Company, which is preserved in the
“London Gazette” of 20th October, 1687.

      THE HUMBLE ADDRESS OF THE MASTERS GOVERNORS ASSISTANTS
        AND MEMBERS OF THE MYSTERY AND COMMONALTY OF BARBERS
        AND SURGEONS OF LONDON.

  MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY

  We having daily before our eyes the munificent Bounties of your Royal
  Brother of Blessed Memory, and other Your Ancestors, and also that of
  your Majesties Gracious Favour, in restoring to us our new Charter,
  we must be esteemed ever ungrateful and undutiful Subjects, if we did
  not with all humility acknowledge the same.

  But we are in more especial manner bound to cast ourselves at Your
  Majesties Feet, and return our most humble and hearty Thanks for
  Your late Declaration; wherein You are Graciously pleased to give
  us Your Royal Word, whereby we are protected in the Profession and
  free Exercise of our Religion, and also in the Enjoyment of our
  Liberties and Properties in Peace and Safety; for which Your Gracious
  Condescension and Goodness (as God hath made it our Duty), Your
  Majesty hath made it our Interest duly to pray to the Divine Majesty
  for his Blessing upon your Royal Person, Family and Government. And
  that after the enjoyment of a long and prosperous reign here, over a
  Dutiful and Obedient People, You may receive an everlasting Crown in
  the World to come.

  And that it may be so, it shall be as it becomes us, the constant and
  utmost endeavour, as well as the hearty Prayer of,

      Dread Sir!

      Your Majesties most humble, most Loyal,
      and most obliged Subjects.

1688. Matters were now rapidly approaching a crisis with James, who
in vain, when too late, sought to conciliate the citizens whom he had
wronged. One of his acts of propitiation was the redelivery to the
Companies of the “surrenders” which they had made of their franchises
and charters in 1684. We have no note of the date of the return of our
surrender; but it was towards the end of November and within about a
fortnight of the King’s flight when this tardy act of justice was done,
and the Barber-Surgeons thus partly restored to their ancient rights
and privileges. The Bill of Rights was shortly afterwards passed, the
_quo warranto_ declared illegal, and all charters granted by Charles
II and James II since the judgment on the _quo warranto_, declared
absolutely null and void, thus practically reinstating the Guilds in
_statu quo ante_.

  28 July, 1690. Ordered that in pursuance of an order of the Com̃on
  Counsell & Lord Mayor &c. that the Company advance towards the
  provideing one Rigiment of Horse & one of Dragoone the sum̃e of one
  hundred pounds.

1699. Jealousies arose in the Company in consequence of the more
frequent election of Surgeons than Barbers, as Governors. The By-Laws
required that every year there should be two Barbers and two Surgeons
chosen (a Barber being defined to be any member who did not practise
Surgery). The Surgeons disregarding the law and the old custom, seem to
have been able to procure the election of an undue number of members of
their own craft to the offices of Master and Wardens, whereupon certain
of the Company filed an information in the King’s Bench against the
Masters or Governors; the Barbers were successful, and having obtained
a Mandamus, a fresh election took place. This altercation between the
Barbers and Surgeons was never forgotten, and, indeed, helped to pave
the way to further estrangement and the absolute separation in 1745.

The following Minutes relate to these proceedings:

  14th December, 1699. Ordered Mr. S{r}geant Wright Mr. S{r}geant
  Darnell Mr. Com̃on S{r}geant & Mr. Dee bee advised with upon the
  Informac͠on ag{t} the Govern{rs.}

  25th January, 1700. Ordered that the Cause ag{t} the Govern{rs} at
  the prosecuc͠on of the Barbers bee referred to S{r}geant Darnell
  & his opinion to bee taken & to pˀceed thereupon, Mr. Oades Mr.
  Pleahill & Mr. Barnard to meet tomorrow at the raine bow to attend
  him by five in the afternoone.

  2nd May, 1700. Ordered Mr. Dee bee consulted concerning the Rule of
  Court of King’s Bench for a copy of the by laws &c. & to follow his
  advice &c. He advised to give Copyes if required & not to oppose it.

  11th May, 1700. Ordered that Mr. S{r}geant Darnell have three guineys
  Mr. Com̃on S{r}geant & Mr. Dee have two a peece given them for the
  Tryall of the Informac͠on on Tuesday next & that all the Court of
  Assistants bee desired to bee there.

  28th June, 1700. Ordered that nothing bee done in the Cause ag{t} the
  Company untill the Mandamus be served & then the Comittee to meete.

  4th July, 1700. A pˀemtory Mandamus being served the last Court,
  Ordered that on Tuesday next by two of the Clock in the afternoon
  there bee an elecc͠on of two Wardens Expert in Barbery for the
  remainder of this yeare.

9th July, 1700. An election took place, with the result that Mr. John
Pinke and Mr. Richard Marks, both being Barbers, were elected Wardens.
Mr. Pinke was already a Warden, but the Mandamus required two Barbers
to be elected, and he was simply re-elected. Mr. Marks took the place
of Mr. Bartholomew King, Surgeon. The Master, Mr. Lichfield, and the
second Warden, Mr. James Wall, were both Surgeons.

13th January, 1709. It was agreed that a new set of By-Laws which had
been settled by the Common Serjeant and Sir Edward Northey should be
presented to the Lord Chancellor, etc., for confirmation, it being
considered that the existing By-Laws were defective in many parts, and
that “good & wholesome Lawes were the life strength & support of this
Company.”

6th April, 1709. A set of By-Laws of this date was confirmed. They are
comprised on thirteen great skins of parchment, and, like previous
ones, are far too voluminous, and indeed not of sufficient interest,
to warrant transcribing, being practically the former set with sundry
technical and minor alterations. There is a fine portrait of Queen
Anne on the first skin, and the Document is signed by William Lord
Cowper, Lord Chancellor, Sir John Holt and Sir John Trevor, Lords Chief
Justices, whose seals are pendant. These By-Laws were brought into
Court on 5th May, 1709.

13th January, 1709. The Court were informed that the Barbers of the
Company were in treaty with the Peruke Makers “of the other end of the
town,” about incorporating them into this Company, and that they were
endeavouring to procure an Act of Parliament to that effect, whereupon
the proposition was approved and leave given to the Barbers to petition
Parliament in the name of the Court.

5th December, 1709. A petition was presented by sundry liverymen
(Barbers) representing that Peruke making was an encroachment upon the
art of Barbery, and praying the Court to obtain an Act of Parliament
incorporating the Peruke Makers with the Barber-Surgeons; the petition
was favourably received by the Court and a Committee appointed, who
met the next day and recommended the proposed union, the Peruke Makers
paying such fees as other members of the Company paid.

24th December, 1709. A petition for an Act was ordered to be drawn by
the Clerk and submitted to several eminent counsel for their perusal.

9th January, 1710. Five hundred copies of the proposed Bill, and a
similar number of the reasons for the suggested incorporation, were
ordered to be printed; but in the result nothing came of this proposed
union with the Peruke Makers.

25th August, 1714. The following precept relating to the Accession of
George I was received:

  TO THE MASTER AND WARDENS OF   }      BY THE MAYOR.
  THE COMPANY OF BARBER SURGEONS.}

  WHEREAS it hath been resolved in Com̃on Councill y{t} if our most
  Gratious Lord King George upon his comeing into this Kingdome be
  pleased to pass through this his City of London, y{t} he shall be
  received by us & our fellow citizens with all the Demonstrationes of
  Joy & affection as are suitable to our duty and Loyalty.

  These are therefore to require you to have your Rayle Cloaths
  Standings Banners Streamers Ensignes & other Ornaments of triumph
  belonging to your Company in a readiness to sett up imẽadiatly upon
  Notice y{t} shall be given you of the time & place by any further
  precept & y{t} yo{r} Cloaths Banners Streamers Ensignes & other
  ornaments be fresh & Good & y{t} you forthwith send to all the
  Liverymen of yo{r} Company that they be well & decently apparrelled

  your Company may be ready (when required) to receive his Maj{tie} to
  his satisfac͠on & the Honour of this City and thereof you are not to
  faile. Dated this 25{th} day of August, 1714.

                                                       GIBSON.

23rd December, 1717. The Company having had great difficulty in
getting in some of their rents, and various of the houses being empty,
determined to sell their property in Mowse Alley, East Smithfield, and
in Butcher Row in St. Botolph’s, Aldgate, agreeing to convey the fee
simple to Mr. Robert Finlay for £1,250.

  And it is further ordered by this Court that till such time as the
  said sume of 1250{li} can be laid out in a convenient purchase of
  houses or lands with the approbac͠on of the Court of Assistants, The
  same shall be forthwith placed out at Interest by the Governors upon
  such Government or other Publick securitys as they shall think fitt,
  But that the said sume of 1250{li} or any part thereof shall never be
  expended on the Company’s common occac͠ons or be any way lessened or
  broke into on any account whatsoever.

17th April, 1718. The following record was ordered to be made of the
“reasons” for disposing of this property:

  The Estate in East Smithfield in eleven years time produced to the
  Company above all disbursements relating thereto[119] but £28 15_s._
  in the whole, Whereas the annual interest of £1250 at 4 pˀ cent. is
  £50.

  [119] But these disbursements had been very heavy _in the nature of
  repairs_.

  Eleven years interest at £50 pˀ ann. for £1250 amounts to without
  computeing Interest upon Interest £550.

  The Company have run behind hand for severall years by means of the
  great sumes laid out upon this Estate.

  Whoever goes backward every year must in time be undone.

  The Estate is still in such a condition as to require a great sum̃e
  of money to be expended upon it in Repairing and Rebuilding in order
  to make it tenantable.

  The Company had not money to lay out upon it.

  If they had, the Estate is so scituated that there is no room to
  hope, even in case the whole had been rebuilt (as it wants to be)
  that it would have answered the laying out so much money.

  And if the Company had let it upon building Leases The pˀsent method
  of building is so as to last exactly the term for which the Lease is
  taken, wouˀd have put the Company in the same condic͠on as they are
  now, when the term expired, besides loss of Rent, & disputes with
  such Tenants in the mean time.

  It was therefore thought better to dispose of the Estate.

Following are the details of negotiations with one or two parties other
than Mr. Finlay, and some curious particulars of the Company’s title to
part of the Estate, which seems to have been an equitable rather than a
legal one, whereby the Court apprehended some difficulty in disposing
of it to another party from whom a somewhat better price might have
been obtained, and therein, under the circumstances, showed themselves
good men of business by concluding with Mr. Finlay: we cannot however
now, but regret that this most valuable property should have passed
from us for so comparatively insignificant a sum. The purchase-money
was laid out in thirteen East India Bonds of £100 each.

  7th April, 1730. M{r} Serj{t} Dickins the Master of the Company
  informing the Court, That he having the honour to be acquainted with
  the Right Honourable The Earl of Burlington and with his Lordships
  most extraordinary genius and superior judgment in Architecture, had
  taken the liberty to address himself to the said noble Earl, and to
  make it his humble request to his Lordship that he would be pleased
  to favour the Company with his opinion, in what manner it would
  be safest and best to repair the anatomical Theatre built by the
  celebrated Inigo Jones about one hundred years ago.

  That his Lordship had thereupon condescended to take a view of the
  Theatre and most obligingly directed the proper method of repairing
  a structure of so peculiar a frame, and afterwards out of his
  accustomed generosity, and in regard to the memory of that great
  Architect offered to defray the expence thereof.

  IT IS THEREUPON RESOLVED NEMINE CONTRADICENTE by this Court, That
  the Master and Wardens of the Company together with the late Master
  William Cotesworth Esq{r} be, and they are hereby desired forthwith
  to wait on the Right Honb̃le The Earl of Burlington, and in the most
  gratefull manner to assure his Lordship in the name of the whole
  Company.

  THAT they do receive this noble instance of his Lordships bounty and
  generosity as a most distinguishing & illustrious mark of honour
  shown by his Lordship to the Company & Profession.

  And that this Court will take care so to record & transmitt the
  remembrance of this magnificent action of his Lordship to their
  successors That the gratitude of the Company to his Lordship’s person
  and memory may be for ever preserved among them.

13th August, 1730. A marble Bust of the Earl of Burlington was ordered
to be set up in the Theatre.

27th April, 1739. “The Court taking into their considerac͠on that
several of their By-Laws, which had been confirmed by the Lord
Chancellor and Lord Chief Justices for the time being, were in want of
alteration, by reason of the variation of the times and circumstances
of the Company and their Members since such By-Laws were made, and
several new By-Laws being also wanting for the better government of
the Company in times to come,” It was ordered that a Committee of six
should consult and draw up fresh By-Laws, to be submitted to a future
Court of Assistants, but in the result no action was taken.

1744. The long slumbering animosity between the Surgeons and the
Barbers had now reached a climax, and indeed it is a matter of surprise
that an union which had become grotesque should have existed for as
many years as it had. The Surgeons, many of whom had attained to
great eminence, naturally chafed under a system which required their
diplomas to be signed by Governors, two of whom were always Barbers,
or members of some trade or profession other than that of a Surgeon,
and with the rapid progress of science and of surgical skill and
knowledge, they felt their alliance with the Barbers a restraint upon
their advancement, as also that the exercise of their profession under
Charters and By-Laws, antiquated in form, and more adapted to the times
in which they were framed, a hindrance rather than an incitement to
further proficiency.

There is little in the records as to this disagreement, it being
tacitly agreed that neither side should place their arguments or
grievances in the books, which were their joint property.

  20th December, 1744. This day the gentlemen on the Surgeons side
  having made known at this Court their desire of being separated from
  the gentlemen on the Barbers and that each may be made a distinct
  and independent Body free from each other, and producing a Case
  intended to be offered to the Honourable House of Commons praying
  such separation, which being read at this Court It was agreed that
  the following gentlemen on the Barbers side viz{t.}--

  M{r.} Warden Negus M{r.} Parker M{r.} Maurice M{r.} Truelove and
  M{r.} Haddon.

  & on the Surgeons side viz{t.}--

  M{r.} Serj{t} Dickins Will{m} Petty Esq{r} James Dansie Esq{re} M{r.}
  Freke and M{r.} Sainthill

  be a Committe appointed to meet on Monday next at the Kings Arms
  Tavern in Saint Paul’s Church Yard at one of the Clock at noon to
  receive the proposals from the Gentlemen on the Surgeon’s side for
  such Separation, and that when they had so done that the Gentlemen on
  the Barber’s side members of this Court should lay the same before
  the Livery on their side, by a Meeting to be had for that purpose,
  and that a Court of Assistants should be held on the Tenth day of
  January next, at which time the Gentlemen on the Barber’s Side
  Members of this Court, should then report their opinion and assent or
  Dissent to such proposals made.

  At the same time it was agreed that any Member of this Court should
  at any time have the free liberty of examining and inspecting into
  the several Books and writings belonging to this Company In case the
  same should be in the presence of the Master or one of the Wardens
  but not otherwise, but no such Books or writings be at any time
  removed from the Hall, on any account whatever unless by a special
  order of this Court first had and obtained for that purpose.

  10th January, 1745. Pursuant to an Order of the last Court of
  Assistants the gentlemen on the Barbers side Members of this Court,
  did this day make their report on the proposals made by the gentlemen
  on the Surgeons side for a separation, by Dissenting in general to
  such proposals made.

By the Journals of the House of Commons, 18 George II, it appears that
the Surgeons on 31st January, 1745, presented a petition to Parliament,
in which among other things they recited the Act, 32 Henry VIII, and
also that Charles I in the 5th year of his reign,

  by Letters Patent under the great seal confirmed the Barber Surgeon’s
  Company in their possessions and privileges and gave the Company
  power to make by-laws and to constitute ten persons to be Examiners
  of Surgeons during their lives, and it was thereby further granted
  that no person whether freeman foreigner native of England or alien
  should practise Surgery in London or Westminster or within seven
  miles of the City of London unless previously examined allowed and
  admitted by the Company in manner therein mentioned; and that the
  Surgeons so examined might practise in any part of England; and that
  the Masters and Governors of the said Company might appoint and
  have a public lecture for the science of Surgery, for the better
  instruction and information in the principles and rudiments of the
  art and science of Surgery, and that no person exercising the art of
  Surgery within the limits therein mentioned should go out or send any
  apprentice or servant from the Port of London to serve in quality
  of a Surgeon for any ship without the approbation and allowance of
  the said Company, in such manner and under such penalties as are
  therein mentioned. That since the said Act for incorporating the two
  said Companies, those of the said Company practising Surgery have
  from their sole and constant study of, and application to the said
  science, rendered the profession and practice thereof of great and
  public benefit and utility to this Kingdom, and that the Barbers
  belonging to the said Corporation are now, and have been many years,
  employed in a business foreign to and independent of the practice of
  Surgery; and that the Surgeons belonging to the same Corporation,
  being now become a numerous and considerable body, and finding their
  union with the Barbers inconvenient in many respects and in no degree
  conducive to the progress or improvement of the art of Surgery,
  are therefore desirous that the Surgeons being freemen of the said
  Company, may be made a Corporation separate and distinct from and
  independent of the Barbers of, and belonging to the said Company;
  and therefore praying the House to give leave that a bill may be
  brought in dissolving and vacating the union and incorporation of the
  Barbers and Surgeons made by the said former act; and for making the
  Surgeons of the said Company a separate and distinct Corporation; and
  for making a partition and division of the real and personal estate
  and effects of and belonging to the said united Company, unto and
  for the separate benefit of the said two Companies so proposed to be
  separated, as to this House shall seem meet and reasonable.

Whereupon it was ordered--

  That the said petition be referred to the consideration of a
  Committee and that they do examine the matter thereof, and report the
  same with their opinion thereupon to the House.

A Committee was at once appointed with power to send for persons,
papers, and records.

On the 6th February the Barbers presented a Petition against the
proposed separation, and asked to be heard by counsel; whereupon it was
ordered--

  That the said petition be referred to the consideration of the
  Committee to whom the petition of the Surgeons of London, whose
  names are thereunto subscribed, on behalf of themselves and other
  the Surgeons in the City and suburbs of London is referred: And that
  these petitioners the said Barbers, if they think fit be heard by
  their Counsel before the said Committee according to the prayer of
  the said petitioners.

This petition of the Barbers to the House of Commons was identical
with a very scarce pamphlet “The Case of the Barbers,” a copy of which
has been kindly given to me by Mr. D’Arcy Power, M.A. It is full of
interest, and will be found in Appendix E.

27th February, 1745. The Committee brought up their report, which was
read by the Clerk, and recited the various documents produced and the
evidence tendered; among other matters it is stated that Mr. John
Hayward, a Past Master, was examined and deposed, that the Master
(who every other year was a Barber) and the Wardens present, sign the
diplomas. That there are ten Examiners who have each half a guinea
for their attendance, and the Master and Wardens have the like. That
he did not know that the presence of Barbers at these examinations
was any inconvenience, but he apprehended it would be more eligible
if the Master were always a Surgeon. That the Barbers are generally
present at the four public lectures of Anatomy, two of which are at
the expense of the Company, the other two being at the expense of the
Surgeons. That the Demonstrators of Anatomy and Osteology are chosen
by the whole Court of Assistants (fifteen of whom are Barbers, and
fifteen Surgeons). That he apprehends the present union is the reason
why so many persons do not bind their sons apprentice at the Hall. He
never knew of the Barbers interfering in or giving interruption to
examinations, and he never heard any fact mentioned as a reason for the
separation desired by the Surgeons, except that a great many foreign
brothers (who are gentlemen that practise both in and out of town)
refuse to come into the Company on account of the present expense.

Being examined as to the money generally given to the Poor’s Box by
Sea Surgeons at the time of their receiving a Qualification, he said
that it was always expected, but that if they are not in a capacity
it is not insisted upon, and that he never heard of any person being
denied a Qualification for refusing to pay it. That the Qualification
is delivered to the party sealed up, to be carried to the Navy Office,
and that the Master commonly signifies to him what fees are expected;
that the said Box is examined every month, and about nine-tenths of
the money distributed by the Master and Wardens, among the poor of the
Barbers.

Being asked what proportion the Barbers pay to the Poor’s Box, he said
that the greatest part of the income applied to that use arises from
the examination of Sea Surgeons, but that the Apprentices of Barbers
(who are as twenty to one) always pay when bound at the Hall, and at
their admission to the freedom, as well as the Surgeons.

Mr. Hayward put before the Committee a statement of the fines received
by the Company, which was as follows--

                                             Surgeons.       Barbers.
                                           _£   s.  d._   _£   s.  d._

  For Freedom by purchase                   10  10   0      6   6   0

   "  Livery fine, and all Offices to the
        Parlor door                         35   0   0     25   0   0

   "  Examination for great Diploma          6   6   0

   "  The fine for not serving the four
        several offices of Master and the
        three Wardens, which the Surgeons

The Clerk’s and Beadle’s fees are not included in the above.

Mr. Joseph Wheeler, the Clerk of the Company, was examined by the
Committee, and generally confirmed Mr. Hayward’s evidence.

The next witness, Mr. Neil Stewart, was evidently called in the
interest of the Surgeons, to show the inconvenience which had arisen
(in his case at all events) by reason of the warrants being issued
by the “_Barbers_ and Surgeons.” He deposed that he was surgeon to
H.M.S. The Looe, and, being taken prisoner by the French, was put in
the common prison at Brest, where he petitioned to be removed to an
open hospital at Dinan, and enclosed his warrant as a surgeon with
his petition to the French authorities; some days after, he enquired
of the “Linguist” as to the success of his petition, and was informed
that “the Superintendent did not know by his warrant whether he
(the witness) was a Barber _or_ a Surgeon: that upon his desiring
the linguist to read the warrant, by which it would appear he was a
surgeon, the linguist replied that it might be so, but that if the
witness had been taken on board one of the King of Great Britain’s
ships it would have been out of doubt.” This witness further stated
that he believed the unfavourable notice which was taken of his
petition was because his warrant came from the Masters of the _Barbers_
and Surgeons.

With reference to the gift of Edward Arris the Court minutes of 29th
February, 1675-6 were produced which stated that “Mr. Edward Arris a
very worthy member of this Company having formerly settled by Deed £30
a year for a dissection of a body yearly and Reading on the Muscles,
desired that deed might be delivered up to him,” and he in return
would pay the Company £510 to enable them to apply the interest to the
same purposes, which was agreed to. Mr. Arris dying on the 28th May,
1676, the Company soon became involved in a Chancery suit with his
son, Dr. Thomas Arris, and the Court minutes of 20th January, 1677-8
were produced and read to the Committee. These set forth the answer
which the Company filed to the Bill of Complaint before the Master of
the Rolls, and stated the circumstances referred to in the minutes of
29th February, 1675-6, and that Mr. Arris gave as his reason for this
“That his only son and heir, the now Doctor, had and did then receive
the profits of the said lands to his own use upon condition and under
promise to pay the said £30 per annum for the said Dissection; but he
found that he did never pay one penny of it, or ever would do, when he
their benefactor was dead, without trouble or suit; with some severe
and sharp expressions, which we will by no means mention, although they
were the very words of the father spoken of the son.”

The answer goes on to express the hope that the Company will not be
compelled to enter into any further covenant with Dr. Arris than they
had done with his father their “pious benefactor,” for the carrying out
of the trust, or be ordered to refund the £510 to Dr. Arris. It also
prayed that he might be ordered to pay the costs of “this troublesome
and unnecessary suit, which doth so much shew what they must expect
from him hereafter, if they should part with the £510.” As the Company
retained the £510 till the separation in 1745, there is no doubt but
that Dr. Arris, as he deserved to do, lost his suit.

Various extracts from the Company’s books were read, on behalf of
the Barbers, to show that the united Company had always assisted the
Surgeons, and promoted the cause and interest of Surgery out of the
common fund of the Barbers and Surgeons.

Part of the Will of Robert Ferbras, Citizen and Surgeon, dated 2nd
December, 1470,[120] was read, whereby it appeared that several estates
formerly belonging to the said Company, were given to the Barbers
before their union with the Surgeons in Henry VIII’s time. And a
declaration of Bryan Sandford, dated 8th March, 1490, was read, whereby
it appeared that the site of the Hall was purchased by the Barbers
before the said Union.

[120] But see p. 61 as to this Will. I cannot explain the discrepancy.

The Committee of the House of Commons reported that they had
recommended the parties to settle the dispute as to the division of the
property between them, and that thereupon the Surgeons had proposed
that they should have given up to them Dr. Gale’s Annuity of £16 per
annum and Alderman Arris’ gift of £510; also that for about three years
until the Surgeons could provide themselves with suitable premises,
they should have the use of the Hall, Theatre, &c., at a nominal rent
of one guinea per annum.

The Barbers agreed to give up Gale’s and Arris’ gifts, but proposed
that the Surgeons should take a lease for such days in the year as they
commonly used the premises, at £80 per annum, and pay the Barbers £100
towards the expenses to which they had been put by this suit in the
Parliament.

In the result the Committee reported:--(_a_) That the Surgeons had
made good the allegations of their petition. (_b_) That the proposed
separation was desirable. (_c_) That the propositions of the Surgeons
touching the division of the property were reasonable.

Subsequently the Bill passed both Houses and received the Royal Assent,
the quaint union being dissolved 25th June, 1745.

By this Act (18 Geo. II) the Surgeons were erected into a separate
Corporation, and the Barbers were re-incorporated under the style of
“The Master, Governors and Commonalty of the Mystery of Barbers of
London.” So much of this Act as relates to the Barbers will be found in
the Appendix F.

The first Court of Assistants of “~The Barbers’ Company~” was held on
the 25th June, 1745, at 10 a.m., and there were present:--

  Mr. JONATHAN MEDLEY                  _Master_.
  Mr. HUMPHRY NEGUS                    _Second Governor_.

  Mr. WILLIAM PARKER. }               { Mr. SAMUEL RUTTER.
  Mr. JOHN BARNWELL.  }               { Mr. ROBERT SCROOBY.
  Mr. JOHN TRUELOVE.  }               { Mr. RICHARD SWITHIN.
  Mr. WILLIAM HADDON. } _Assistants._ { Mr. EDWARD COLEBECK.
  Mr. JOHN NEGUS.     }               { Mr. TOGARMAH JONES.
  Mr. EDWARD BOXLEY.  }               { Mr. JOHN GURNEY.

The Act of Separation being read, and the Oaths as formerly required to
be taken by Freemen, Master, Warden, Assistant, Clerk, and Beadle being
also read and considered, the Court settled and formulated the various
Oaths, and the same are entered in the Minutes.

The Election of nine fit and able persons to be Assistants was then
proceeded with, and Mr. William Jackson, Mr. John Bearblock, Mr.
Will{m.} Roberts, Mr. Thomas Cotton, Mr. John Whiting, Mr. Richard
Lookes, James Theobald, Esqre., Peter Theobald, Esqre., and Mr. John
Pepys, were unanimously elected.

Mr. Edward Boxley and Mr. Samuel Rutter were chosen third and fourth
Governors or Wardens.

Thanks were voted to Mr. Jonathan Medley and Mr. Humphry Negus “for
their great care in defending and preserving the Rights Priviledges and
property of this Company on their Separation from the Surgeons.”

Thanks were also voted to Mr. John Paterson “for his great care and
diligence in executing the orders and directions of the Master and
Governor about the defence and preservation of the rights priviledges
and property of the Company” and to further mark their sense of the
same, the Court unanimously elected Mr. Paterson as Clerk.

The two Beadles, Henry Gretton and William Littlebury were re-elected.

It was ordered that all Charters, Books, Plate and goods belonging
to the Company, then in the custody of Mr. Joseph Wheeler (the late
Clerk) should be delivered to Mr. Paterson, who was to make and sign an
Inventory of the same, and also to examine Mr. Wheeler’s accounts, and
report thereon to the Court.

The Common Seal was directed to be altered by omitting the words ET
CHIRURGORUM and by adding ANNO MDCCXLV.

A Committee was appointed to peruse the By-Laws of the late United
Company, and to report as to which of them required amendment or were
fit to be repealed or added to.

8th August, 1751. Mr. John Brooks attended and produced a Deed to
which he requested the subscription of the Court; this deed recited
that by an Act of Parliament passed in the 10th year of Queen Anne,
it was enacted that a duty of 2_d._ per lb. should be laid upon all
starch imported, and of 1_d._ per lb. upon all starch made in Great
Britain, that no perfumer, barber, or seller of hair-powder should
mix any powder of alabaster, plaster of Paris, whiting, lime, etc.
(sweet scents excepted), with any starch to be made use of for making
hair-powder, under pain of forfeiting the hair-powder and £50, and
that any person who should expose the same for sale should forfeit
it and £20. Also that by further Acts additional duties were laid
upon starch. And by an Act passed in the 4th year of George II the
penalties were somewhat mitigated. “And whereas the said laws with
respect to hair-powder have by experience been found not to answer the
end proposed by the Legislature, the sum arising by the said duties
upon starch and hair-powder having gradually lessened, whilst the
fair traders have been great sufferers by the practice of those who
by the greatness of the duty have attempted to make vend or use the
said prohibited articles. And whereas the trade or business of making
vending or dressing of Perukes or other Ornaments of hair for the head
and also of cutting and dressing the hair of the head being considered
as distinct from the business of Barbers is under no regulation
whatever,” etc., the parties whom Mr. Brooks represented (and whose
names were signed to the deed) had, therefore, agreed to join in an
application to Parliament for reducing the duties on hair-powder, as
also for incorporating all persons carrying on the trade of Barbers and
Peruke-makers within the Bills of Mortality, into one joint Corporation
or Body politick, and for restraining persons from exercising those
trades who had not served seven years’ apprenticeship.

It was stated that subscriptions towards defraying the costs of the
proposed Bill had been paid to Messrs. Gosling & Bennett, Bankers in
Fleet Street, that John Paterson, Esq., Clerk of the Company, was
Solicitor for the Bill, and Mr. John Brooks was Secretary of the
Petitioners.

The Court, having considered the application, decided to contribute
Twenty Guineas, but the matter seems to have been in abeyance for
eighteen months, as the petition to the House of Commons was not
sealed by the Company until the 7th January, 1753.

13th January, 1753. The petition was this day presented and is recorded
in the Journals of the House; it states, among other things, that the
Company “are in danger of being unable to support themselves and that
the petitioners who exercise the art of Peruke making in the liberties
and neighbourhood of the said City are not a body corporate, nor under
any order or regulation; for want whereof great frauds are practised
in the said manufacture to the discouragement of the fair trader, and
manifest injury of the consumer, And therefore praying the House that
leave may be given for the bringing in a Bill for incorporating the
Peruke makers as well within as without the liberties of the City of
London, and within such distance thereof as the House shall think fit,
with the said petitioners”--the Barbers’ Company. This petition was
referred to a Committee, but no report of that Committee is entered in
the Journals.

4th December, 1764. The Peruke makers turned up again in 1764, for we
find in the Minutes that certain of them attended with the draft of
a petition to the King, to which they asked the assent of the Court.
This petition which strangely commenced “We the Company of Barbers _and
Peruke makers_,” stated that the suppliants laid before his Majesty the
distresses into which the Peruke makers had fallen by reason of the
change of fashion, and thus appeals to the King, “Where can we look
for relief but there only where it is to be found, for as the Fashion
your Majesty approves will very justly be a pattern to your subjects,
We most humbly hope not to be too bold in wishing Perukes may soon be
as much in fashion as the wearing of hair is at present, which will
increase the Revenue, give happiness to the indigent and distressed
Peruke makers, and increase the many great unmerited Favours, We as a
Company have received from Royal Hands!”

16th January, 1765. The Court took this ridiculous petition into
consideration, and of course refused to adopt it, informing the
suppliants that they were concerned to observe the decay in their
trade, as it was connected by usage with that of Barbery, but as the
Charters of the Company did not extend to Peruke making, the Court
could not with propriety address his Majesty on the subject.

It was ordered that no Barber should take a “foreigner” as journeyman
and set him to work, before presenting him to the Master and Wardens,
under a penalty of 3_s._ 4_d._ per week.

This order was made because many foreigners (_i.e._, non-freemen) who
were inexpert had lately come into the City, and the Court directed
that each foreigner should give proof of his skill, and then that he
should remain for one year only and in one service, and no Barber was
to pay a foreigner higher wages than the Masters should from time to
time “sess” or determine under a penalty of 13_s._ 4_d._ for “every
weke so offending.” The Beadle was directed to keep a register book of
all foreigners for the year, and when the year was expired, the Barber
who kept a foreigner and was minded to keep him longer was to come to
the Hall within fourteen days to have him re-registered under a penalty
of 3_s._ 4_d._ per week. And no Barber was to “entyce or envegyll any
mans servant from him upon peyne of forfeyting for a fyne xiij{s.}
iiij{d.}”

The Court fixed the wages of these men as follows--

set forth by the Corporation of London concerning Orphans, and no man
was to sit out of his appointed place, under a penalty.

  sayed masse[140] to be at the chardgs of the Companye.

  before the lorde cheefe Justice And yt is ordered y{t} the saide
  Parke shall [be] & is upon his humble submyssion remytted.

16th Jan., 1567. The old vellum book of ordinances, etc., containing
portions of the four Gospels in Latin, and still in our possession is
probably the book referred to in the minute of this date, which states
that Willm̄ Grene had “taken an othe upon the blacke booke that serveth
in this howse for the same purpose.”

  13th Nov., 1567. Yt ys ordayned that Wyllyam Bull Chrystofor
  Swalldell William Crowe Wyllyam Grene Henry Rankyn and Leonard Coxe

imprisoned.

  comanded that he shall agree w{th} this mystery as a brother or ells

  Richard Wysto is relynquyshed depryved and dysmyst of his office
  and yong{r} govˀnorshyp and also fourth of assystents of the saide
  mystery.

Wysto appears from time to time to have given the Court trouble, his
offence on this particular occasion being that he had ordered his
apprentice to let a man blood in the Compter contrary to the order of
the Aldermen. Wysto was contumacious for a long period, but seems on
17th July, 1572, to have made humble submission and apology, whereupon
an order was made “That none do stirre upp any talke consr̃ninge
the deprivac͠on or submyssion of Ric. Wistowe”; he was subsequently
re-admitted on to the Court and served Master 1586, but the animus
against him revived, and on 7th November, 1587, certain parties were
before the Court for reviling him on the old score, and were duly
threatened and admonished as to their future behaviour.

  22nd November, 1569. Here was Phillip Jordan for trymming upon the
  sabboth daye and he once agayne is warned upon the penalltie of the
  acte that he do y{t} hence forwardes no more (see 18th May, 1568).

  10th October, 1570. Margaret y{t} was M{r} Vaughan[147] his mayde is
  graunted to kepe one Sonday her wedyng in the hall & no more.

  [147] George Vaughan, Master 1569.

1568 to 1570. There are several entries in the books of members of the
Court being removed for misbehaviour.

27th January, 1571. It was ordered that--

  a newe Bayle be made to thentent them of the clothing of this
  mysterie maie decentlie stand to attend all soch tymes as it shall
  please the Queenes ma{tie} to come through the citie of London.

The Bayle was a movable stand or platform; there are various notices as
to the one previously in use, having been out of repair. It was taken
out on all great days of processions or triumphs and on Christmas day
when the “lorde maior went to Poules,” and numerous references are also
made to the Company’s banners which accompanied it.

  19th January, 1573. Here was Willm̄ Carrington for havinge iiij
  servaunts one Christmas even and ordre was taken that he should laye

  26th May, 1573. Here was John Johnsonne and brought in his fyne for
  kepinge a foryner uncest xx{d.}

There are frequent entries of freemen being fined for not “cessing”
foreigners and journeymen, and for teaching foreigners their “science.”

It would seem from the following precise minute that commitments to
prison were made by the Court direct, and not always upon Warrants
obtained from the Lord Mayor or a Justice.

  15th March, 1575. Here was one Mˀkes [Markes] servñte w{th} M{r}
  Tholmwood sometyme, sent to the Compter by Willm̄ Eden Clark to this
  misterye for not pˀforming an Awarde made betwene the saide M{r}
  Tholmwood and the saide Mˀkes and divers others stubborne and lewde

Company. Four freemen (one being an Assistant) had been “put into”
the Court of Exchequer by “one Holmes an Informer for using both
Barbery and Chirurgery against the Statute,” and the Court, without
troubling to enquire if the offence had been committed or not, ordered
that £10 should be lent the parties to assist them in defending the
suit. At the next Court the matter was much debated as to whether the
Barber-Surgeons should go on with their defence or make terms with the
informer, and the parties themselves were consulted, whereupon it was
finally decided “among themselves to agree w{th} the said Informer

declared--

  The occasion of this solempne meeteing & the necessarye succession

  Assembly made their repaire to the Church and after Sermon upon their
  returne to the Hall the Masters being called to those 12 Electors
  they were informed that the Election could not proceede and be made,

by reason that certain of the Electors being of divers trades were
unable to agree upon two persons expert in Barbery, and these Electors
refusing to choose two Masters Barbers, a Court was at once held and
the six Barber Electors were discharged, six more Electors being chosen
and called; two of these, however, being contaminated by those already
dismissed, refused to serve, and eventually a fresh set of Electors was
chosen, who retired, and elected Mr. William Clowes, Serjeant-Surgeon
to the King, as Master, and three others Wardens, “and after dinner

Richard Morrice, an Assistant, a suit was prosecuted against Morrice
in the Earl Marshal’s Court, when the sentence pronounced against him
was that he should attend the Court at the Hall, and there bareheaded
rehearse in an audible voice an abject apology, the exact words of
which are set out. This Morrice did, and the Master and Wardens having
testified the same, he was again called into Court, when it would seem
that his apology had been made under fear of the Earl Marshal and
not of his free will, for the Court calling upon him to make answer
“for his contentious carriage & foule & bitter languages & invective
speeches by him given from Court to Court ag{t} divers Assistantꝭ to
the generall disturbance of their Courtꝭ he refused to cleare himselfe
or to give answeare,” whereupon the Court dismissed him from his place
as an Assistant.

  hath bin for a long time in Captivity in Turkey iiij{li} towards the
  setting him forth to sea and doth order that he be admitted into the

See the Minute 5th February, 1629. John Franck (the son of a Liveryman)
was doubtless a “foreign brother,” and entitled to his freedom by
patrimony upon payment of the fine, which the Court now ordered to be
dispensed with if he wished to take up his freedom. Being a Sea Surgeon
only, it was not necessary that he should be free of the Company. He
had probably been in slavery 18 years!

Several entries similar to the following are to be found in the books.

  9th August, 1647. Upon the humble suite of Thomas Tomlinson an
  ancient Member of this Company and of the Livery now fallen into

Barber-Surgeons £16 per annum, payable out of certain houses on Snow
hill, in the parish of Saint Sepulchre, for the founding of an Anatomy
lecture in the name of Gale’s Anatomy. This trust was transferred to
the Surgeons’ Company in 1745.

Our Minute Books from the year _1651 to 1689_ are unhappily lost;
they are known to have been at the Hall as recently as 1832. Should
any reader ever light upon them, he is particularly entreated to
communicate with the Clerk of the Company or with the author.

1689. The practice was now adopted of entering all admissions to the
freedom, etc., in the Court Minute Books (as well as in the Register)
the forms being as follows:--

3rd September, 1689. For an apprentice:

  Johẽs Rawson app̃r Caroli Peters admĩs est ex Rẽl Magr̃i & Jur̃.

  17th January, 1690. This day an order was sealed to presse 40
  Surgeons mates for the Kings service in Ireland.

At this period all freemen on their admission “took the oathes
menc͠oned in a late Act of Parliament & subscribed the Declarac͠on
therein named”: these were the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy as
required by the “Bill of Rights” (passed December, 1689).

  2nd July, 1690. Ordered that the Clarke keep an accompt of all pˀsons
  faleing at a Court of Assistants and that every one faileing for

  Assistants as he hath been chosen one of them.

18th June, 1696. A new sun dial was ordered to be put up.

About this period there seems to have been a general disinclination
to serve as an Assistant, many of the Livery being fined £10 for
refusing to serve the office, while some who had sat as Assistants were
dismissed the Court for non-attendance.

  25th October, 1697. Ordered that the Barge house bee mended & M{r}

  Comittee that he deserves soe to bee as alsoe for being any longer
  an examin{r} he haveing acted contrary to the establish{mt} of the
  Corporac͠on in the s{d} offices.

8th November, 1700. A Committee of the Court having waited upon the
Commissioners of the Navy and reported that Mr. Lichfeild had committed
irregularities in certifying men as qualified Surgeons for sea service,
such men not being duly qualified, the Court adjudged him to be
dismissed from his office of an Examiner in Surgery, and out of the
Court of Assistants.

10th March, 1707. The new Clerk, Mr. Chas. Bernard, seems to have
been industrious in searching out practising Barbers not free of the
Company, as also others who had committed abuses; several were fined
and compelled to take up their freedom and this day the following
entries occur:--

  Clyett being sum̃oned for Shaveing on Sunday last appeared before the
  Comittee and the fact being plainly proved against him the Comittee
  fined him ten shillings for his said offence.

  Newland being sum̃oned for the like offence appeared also before
  the Comittee but there being no possitive proofe against him he was
  dismissed.

  John Gould a Dutchman being sum̃oned for keeping a Shopp and
  exercising the trade of a Barber not being free of this Company And
  the matter being plainly proved against him the Comittee ordered him
  to be prosecuted on the statutes of the 32nd of Hen 8{th} and the

  that all other persons exerciseing Barbery not being ffree of this
  Company be sum̃oned.

17th March, 1707. Nineteen delinquents who had been summoned appeared,
and their cases were heard; a few examples will suffice--One Darby was
“seen to comb a persons haire on Sunday morning last but alleadging
that it was his ffather,” he was let off with 5_s._ fine.

Lewis Roger made answer that it “was onely his Apprentice combing a
persons haire without his knowledge and that it was his first offence,”
he likewise escaped with a 5_s._ fine.

James Good was more fortunate, for proving that his offence “was onely
the Combing of a Lodgers Wigg,” he escaped.

Willm. Haslegrove appears to have filled up the measure of his
iniquity, for being detected in “actually shaveing a person on Sunday
morning,” he was fined 10_s._

Samuel Beaumont, charged with keeping two Barbers’ shops, had a month
given him to part with one of them, and John Shoard who, not being free
of the Company, kept a Barber’s shop in Cloth Fair, was ordered to quit
the same within two months.

  31st March, 1707. Elizabeth Presbury being sumoned appeared &
  alleadged that she was very poore & that her husband was an Idle man
  and promised to reforme her method whereupon the Comittee excused her.

The number of Barbers fined for working on Sundays, or for keeping shop
not being free, was enormous, and it becomes wearying to travel through
the records of their offences and fines.

  17th June, 1708. Ordered that the Company’s Barge house and the
  Dwelling house thereunto belonging be forthwith repaired.

13th January, 1709. Sir Edward Northey was appointed standing counsel
to the Company with a yearly retainer of two guineas.

  15th April, 1709. Upon complaint made against one Henry Drudge for

  attended and alleadged that he haveing been a Soldier in the late
  Warr thought himself intituled to keep his Shoppe without takeing
  up his ffreedome, by Virtue of the Act of Parliament made upon the
  disbanding the Army which gives liberty to disbanded soldiers to
  exercise any trade within the Corporations or places where they were
  borne, althoˀ they had not served seven years to it But the Court
  believing that act did not extend to Drudge by reason he was not
  borne in London, ordered that in case he did not shut up his Shop in
  a month’s time he should be prosecuted.

21st July, 1709. In consequence of the great expense to which the
Company had been put in the repairs to the Hall, the Court determined
to call thirty-one freemen into the Livery, and the fine being £10 each
on admission or £20 on refusal, a considerable sum was realized.

It having been suggested to the Court that the yeomanry objected to
pay 20_s._ for “corn money” when called to the Livery, the Clerk was
directed to enquire into the origin of that tax, and finding that it
had been originally levied on each member taking his livery, to satisfy
the precepts made in 1633, and afterwards for providing a stock of
corn for the City; and for that at the present time the Company had no
Granary or stock of corn to provide, and “being out of debt,” it was
ordered that in future this fine should be discontinued.

18th August, 1709. At the Election, ten of the Livery who had attended
without their gowns, were severally fined and paid 1_s._ each, and
there are other references to Assistants being fined for not appearing

  for being copartner with a fforreigner & the fact being made appeare

Mr. Joseph Cosins, also an Assistant, and his junior in the freedom,
had always taken precedence of him at the Courts, whereupon the matter
was considered and the following order made:--

  Forasmuch as it appeared that M{r} Cosins was first chosen into the
  Court of Assistants & that it is in the power of this Court to chuse
  whom they shall think fitt to be an Assistant out of the whole Livery
  without respect to Seniority & for that M{r} Cosins continued for
  many years in his present station as Assistant The Court were of
  opinion & did so declare themselves to be That the s{d} M{r} Cosins

  under a necessity of becomeing a freeman of the Vintners Company
  or of takeing a License from the Crown to retail wine and praying

Barbers, applied to the Court, giving their reasons and praying that
the Court would petition the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council
to suspend the act of Common Council restraining them from employing
foreigners as journeymen, whereupon the matter was considered and
the Court thought it would be contrary to their oaths to join in any
such petition, because it was a standing By-Law of the Company, as
well as of the City, that no Barber should employ any foreigner as a
journeyman; it was also considered that such a liberty would prove a
great discouragement to apprentices and that the present inconvenience
complained of would soon be cured if Masters would sufficiently
instruct their apprentices so as to make them useful during their
servitude and competent as journeymen afterwards. The Court further
decided to oppose, by every means in its power, the movement set on
foot by Mr. Berney and his friends.

24th June, 1722. The lease of the Barge-house at Lambeth expiring in
April, 1723, and the Archbishop having offered to renew the same for
21 years at £10 per annum and £100 fine, it was resolved not to renew
it, in consequence of its being an unprofitable property, and the
Company not then having a barge. The Barber-Surgeons let off part of
their Barge-house to the Drapers and Ironmongers, and the Clerk was
instructed to give those Companies notice that it was not the intention
of this Company to renew the lease from the Archbishop.

2nd December, 1729. In consequence (as was alleged) of the difficulty

8th August, 1745. The Clerk reporting that many of the Company, as well
as Surgeons lately free of the Barber-Surgeons’ Company, were greatly
in arrear in their quarterage, he was ordered to acquaint them that
unless the said arrears were paid up forthwith, they would be sued.

17th September, 1745. The Company of Surgeons sent to the Company of
Barbers two documents under their Common Seal, the one authorising
Mr. Joseph Cruttenden to peruse and copy any Charters or documents in
the possession of the Barbers, and the other empowering him to take
possession of any books, papers or writings relating to Surgeons or
Surgery only, on behalf of the Company of Surgeons; whereupon the Court
acceded to the request, and gave instructions as to the same.

4th December, 1745. Mr. Cruttenden applied on behalf of the Surgeons’
Company for £510 (the Arrisian endowment) which had been directed to
be paid by the Act of Parliament, whereupon the Master told him that
by reason of the late fall in the Public Stocks, the Company could
not without great loss, raise the money, but were ready to give the
Surgeons a proper bond for the same, with Interest.

able persons to take the Livery, and were ordered to be summoned for

  M{r} Whiston the Bookseller to putt the Company’s Library in order
  and to make a Catalogue and valuation thereof And that M{r} Whiston
  had appraised the same at Twenty Guineas And the Clerk acquainting
  the Court that a learned Physican had offered twenty-five Guineas for
  the Library together with the Skeleton and other curiosities formerly
  kept in the Library It was ordered that the Clerk should acquaint the
  Master of the Worshipfull Company of Surgeons with the said offer
  made to this Company And that this Court being desirous to manifest
  their esteem for and preserve the ffriendship of the Surgeons did
  give them the refusal of the said Library Skeleton and Curiosities
  at the said price of Twenty ffive Guineas And that in case of their
  acceptance thereof the rich and ancient Pall belonging to this
  Company should be at their service as a free gift.

16th July, 1747. The Clerk reported that he had made the above offer
to the Surgeons who replied that they considered themselves entitled

9th August, 1753. The Great Hall, Kitchen and Lobby were ordered to be
repaired by Mr. Reynolds in accordance with his Estimate of £101 17_s._
6_d._

  8th August, 1754. Ordered that the thanks of this Court be given to
  James Theobald Esq{r} one of the Ancient Masters of the Company for
  the magnificent Lustre by him lately presented and at his Expense
  fixed up in their great parlor assuring him This Court doth most
  gratefully accept the same as a monument of his regard for the honor
  and prosperity of the Company.

This handsome lustre still adorns the Court Room.

12th September, 1754. The Court having considered the state of the
Theatre, which was out of repair, and for which the Company had no use,
ordered advertisements to be inserted twice in three daily papers,
asking for tenders for the materials of the same, and for pulling down
and clearing it away. The “N.B.” to the advertisement states that “The
Doors, Benches and Railes of the said Theatre are of Cedar.”

1st October, 1754. Three tenders for the materials of the Theatre were
received, £21 10_s._ 0_d._, £32 and £35 respectively, and the decision
thereon postponed.

4th February, 1755. William Shakespear (Barber) the apprentice of
Richard Hulett, was admitted to the freedom.

5th June, 1764. The Clerk informed the Court of the death of Mrs.
Elizabeth I’Ans, widow of Mr. Michael I’Ans, and that the Master and
Wardens had, on the 23rd May, received of the Executors of Mr. I’Ans
£2,200--3-1/2 per cent. Bank Annuities, and £75 in accordance with Mr.
I’Ans’ will.

1764 and 1765. Mr. James Clowes who had been summoned to take up the
Livery, refused to do so, whereupon he was sued for the fine of £20 and
judgment obtained against him with costs.

14th August, 1766. A Committee having been appointed to examine and
report upon the Theatre, and having done so, were now authorised to
apply to the Court of Common Council for permission to pull down the
same, and to treat with that Court for the purchase of the ground, for
which the Company paid the City £3 per annum under an old lease.

3rd November, 1767. The City Comptroller having requested the Company
to make an offer for the site of the Theatre, it was resolved that 30
years’ purchase (£90) be offered for the same.

7th February, 1769. A plan of the ground leased by the City to the
Company and on which the Theatre stood, having been prepared by Mr.
George Dance, Clerk of the Works to the City, it was laid before the
Court, and the City sold the fee simple to the Company for £90. Would
that one could buy City freeholds at the same rate now!

2nd September, 1783. Mr. Sylvanus Hall, of Paternoster Row, Carpenter,
proposed to take a lease of the ground on which the Theatre stood,
to take down the whole building, and to erect two dwelling houses on
the site similar to those he had already built in Monkwell Street.
The lease to commence at Christmas, 1784, and to be for 61 years at
£10 ground rent. He also proposed to pay the Company £20 for the old
materials of the Theatre and to clear the same away. To all these
propositions the Court agreed, and Mr. Hall paid a guinea as earnest
money.

1st February, 1785. Mr. Hall having pulled down the Theatre, the Clerk
was instructed to write to him for the £20 for the old materials which
he had removed.

  4th October, 1791. There being a sufficient number of Members present
  to form a Court of Assistants, thoˀ no such Court was called, the
  Master took the sense of the Members present, as an adjournment from
  the last Court of Assistants, whether the Company should go out
  in the usual procession the ensuing Lord Mayor’s day, when on the
  question being put, the same was resolved in the negative.

  4th November, 1794. M{r} Thomas Holehouse who was on the 1{st} July
  last elected on the Livery of this Company, but had refused to take
  upon him the same, without shewing any cause to the Contrary, and
  against whom an Action had been commenced for the recovery of Twenty
  Pounds the penalty incurred by such his refusal, this day attended
  and paid the said sum of Twenty pounds together with the costs of the
  said Action.

9th November, 1795. The following Circular was distributed amongst the
Livery at the dinner this day:--

  The Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Barbers having
  received information that many persons residing within the City of
  London carry on the Trade of a Barber and Hair dresser without being
  free of this Company to the great prejudice of the Members and the
  rights of the Company Do hereby give notice that they have come to a
  resolution to prosecute all persons carrying on the trade of a Barber
  or Hair dresser within the said City not being free of this Company
  and they request the assistance of their Members for that purpose for
  the benefit of the Company and Trade at large; any information to
  their Clerk at the Hall will be duly attended to.

                             By order of Court,

                                             EDW{D} GROSE SMITH,

                                                               Clerk.

9th November, 1796. The By-Laws of the Company having been found,
on the opinion of Mr. Serjeant Adair, insufficient to enforce the
payment of fines for the refusal to serve various offices, a new set
was drawn up by the Clerk, and submitted to and approved by the Court,
who ordered the Clerk to get the same confirmed and allowed by the Lord
Chancellor and two Chief Justices, but this was never done.

5th September, 1797. The Mahogany table now in the Court Room was made
about this time. There is a tradition that the bulb-shaped end of it
was a portion of the old dissecting table used by the Surgeons. If so,
its latter days are more cheerful than its first.

1796 to 1799. Several Barbers were prosecuted for exercising their
Trade within the limits of the Company’s Charters and brought to terms,
generally they became freemen, and then were compelled to come on to
the livery; in other cases the barbers removed out the jurisdiction,
and paid the costs.

18th May, 1802. The Commissioners for the Public Lottery having
advertised for a place in which to hold the lotteries, the Court
decided to send in proposals offering the use of the Hall (under
certain restrictions) for the next three lotteries for Six hundred
guineas, but the offer was not accepted.

1st August, 1809. A case was submitted to the Attorney General (Sir R.
Gibbs) who gave an opinion that the freemen of the Company were exempt
from serving on Juries, but not from serving as Constables.

4th February, 1812. A memorial signed by four freemen of the Company
was presented to the Court, the purport of which was that the
memorialists having been summoned to act as Ward Constables had refused
to serve, and that thereupon actions had been brought against them,
which, being tried before Lord Ellenborough, the verdicts were against
them and they were ordered to pay the costs (£333 9_s._ 0_d._). The
memorialists alleging that they defended the actions for the benefit of
the Company and really to uphold its privileges, prayed that they might
be reimbursed the costs, which, however, the Court declined to accede
to, but ordered that £12, which had been paid to the Company for copies
of the Charters, should be refunded.

1814. The Churchwardens of St. Olave, Silver Street, having assessed
the Hall at £172, they were requested to attend the next Court which
they did, and the following delightful method of settling these matters
is recommended to the Authorities nowadays.

  1st November, 1814. The parish officers of Saint Olave Silver
  Street attended & stated to the Court that the Vestry of that
  Parish had taken the subject of the Poor rate into consideration,
  and considering the great increase of the rate they left it to the
  Company to say what they were agreeable to be rated at; the Court
  proposed to say £100 per annum; the gentlemen (having withdrawn)
  were then called in and informed of such proposal, with which they
  cordially acquiesced.

  2nd April, 1816. Alexander Rowland the younger [of Macassar oil fame]
  of Kirby Street Hatton Garden, Barber was admitted to the Livery.

3rd May, 1825. The Livery stand, being in a decayed and useless
condition, was ordered to be sold.

2nd May, 1826. But as a purchaser could not be found, the Master
offered to give £5 for it, which was accepted, and this, together with
an additional £5, was ordered to be given to the Committee for the
Relief of Distressed Manufacturers.

5th February, 1861. Mr. John Atkinson gave £100 consols for the purpose
of distributing the dividends thereof in the purchase of Bibles and
Prayer Books for the poor members of the Company.

7th February, 1862. Mr. John Atkinson’s Will reciting a munificent
bequest to the Company is set out in the minutes of this date.

3rd February, 1863. A Statement of the property left by Mr. John
Atkinson is recorded in a letter from the Solicitors to his Trustees
directed to the Court, and entered in the minutes of this date.

[Illustration: PORTION OF THE MASTER’S SILVER GARLAND (DATE 1629).]

PRECEDENCE.


The Barbers’ Company is ranked the seventeenth in order of the City
Companies, and is the fifth after the “Twelve great Companies,”
the thirteenth being the Dyers, fourteenth Brewers, fifteenth
Leathersellers, sixteenth Pewterers, seventeenth Barbers, eighteenth
Cutlers, etc.

The question of precedency in former times gave rise to many
contentions between the City Guilds, and the Barber-Surgeons seem
to have had some experience in these quarrels: the City pageants,
processions, and public attendances at church, were numerous in the
days of the Tudors and Stuarts, and at most of these the Livery
Companies attended, each guild jealously striving to keep its place,
and no doubt to advance its position whenever opportunity arose.

There are extant, lists of the Companies in the City books, in which
our Company takes various positions; and Stow, having incorporated one
of these lists in his Survey, has given it an authority as a table
of precedence which it was never intended to possess; he furnishes a
list of the Companies attending the Lord Mayor’s feast, 23rd Henry VIII
(1531), and places the Barbers as the thirty-second, whereas at that
time they were undoubtedly the twenty-eighth.

1516. The first authentic reference to our Company’s standing is found
in _Letter-Book N._ leaf 5 (January, 1516), where it is ordained that
the Barbers, although they claimed of their ancient right to be the
seventeenth Company, yet were adjudged to take the twenty-eighth place,
following the Cordwainers, and preceding the Paynter-Stainers.

1532. This order was probably in force until February, 1532, when the
Barbers got back their old position (_Repertory_ 8, leaf 272) and an
officer was directed to wait on the Pewterers to “shewe theym that
the seyd Company of Barbours Surgeons be Restored ageyn to their olde
Rowme.” Three months later (May, 1532), the Barbers were “taken down
one,” and directed to occupy the eighteenth place.

1533. In February, 1533 (_Letter-Book O._ _fo._ 213), is a record which
is somewhat puzzling, as, altogether ignoring the orders of February
and May, 1532, it is stated that the Barber-Surgeons had petitioned
to be restored to their old place of seventeenth Company, from which
it is said they were dispossessed about sixteen years back (evidently
alluding to the order of January, 1516), “so that they be nowe the xxix
or xxx{th} Companye yn thordre of such goynges,” etc.

Perhaps the orders of February and May, 1532, had been disregarded by
the other guilds, and our Company forcibly ousted from their rightful
position, so that this is in effect an application for a confirmatory
order, which was granted, and thus they were again fixed as the
seventeenth Company.

1534. The Barbers must have given some offence to the Civic authorities
in 1534, for in October of that year (_Repertory_ 9, leaf 79) the
last-named order was repealed, and they were put back again to the
twenty-eighth place, and further the Company were ordered that they
“shall no more goo yn pˀcessyons, standyngꝭ, Rydyngꝭ, goyngꝭ, and other
assembles from hensfurth, tyll it be otherwyse ordered by thys coˀrte.”

1535. This vacillation on the part of the Court of Aldermen in settling
our position, was not yet at an end, for in March, 1535, we were again
placed seventeenth, to come before the Cutlers and after the Pewterers,
and this order was confirmed no less than four times in 1535, and twice
in 1536.

1604. At a Royal Procession on the 15th March, 1604, our Company got
misplaced by some of the Marshals, and this led to another application
to the Court of Aldermen, whereupon a peremptory order was made that
the Barber-Surgeons should stand sixteenth in precedence. This order
is set out in full elsewhere (see page 195); the sixteenth place
was then accorded to us in consequence of the Stockfishmongers, who
formerly held the twelfth place, having been dissolved, whereby the
Barber-Surgeons went up one: the Clothworkers who, at that time were
the thirteenth Company, then became the twelfth.

Some short time afterwards, the Dyers, who had been the eighteenth
Company, got the thirteenth place, and we reverted to our old position
of seventeenth Company in which we still continue.

1606. An attempt to misplace us was made in July, 1606, but this was
successfully resisted. (See p. 116.)

COURT OF ASSISTANTS.


The constitution of the governing body of the Company has grown up in
the course of time from one Prime Master or Ruler to a Master with
three Wardens and twenty Assistants, forming a Court of twenty-four
members.

We gather from the earliest records, that the business of the Company
was then transacted by the meeting together in Common Hall, of the
whole fraternity (which probably included both freemen and liverymen),
under the presidency of a single Master, who, as in the case of Richard
le Barber in 1308, was invested with the supervision of the craft, and
power to make search and scrutiny, and to punish offenders.

In 1376 two Masters were appointed to rule the craft, while in 1388 we
find that two Masters and two “Surveyors” formed the governing body.

In 1416 is recorded the admission of five Masters, three of whom are
described as “Barbitonsores” (_i.e._, Barbers proper) and two as
“Masters of the Barbers exercising the faculty of Surgery.” In 1428
there were four Masters, two of each class, and this number was the
governing body at the time of Edward IV’s Charter of Incorporation, in
1462.

As has been elsewhere remarked, this Charter provides for the
appointment of two Masters only, and they to be skilled in Surgery,
to be chosen by twelve Electors taken from the Commonalty; but as our
records preserve the names of four Masters elected in that year, and
so on ever since in unbroken succession, there cannot be any doubt
but that (the Charter dealing almost entirely with the regulation of
matters surgical) the two Masters of the “Barbers side” were left to be
elected in accordance with old custom, or under the By-laws which the
Company were, by their Charter, empowered to make.

At what period a Court of Assistants was created in our Company is
unknown, but I am inclined to think the date is about 1480 to 1500.
The four “Masters or Governors” (answering to our “Master and three
Wardens”) were chosen out of the Commonalty by twelve electors yearly,
and do not, as seems by the lists preserved, appear to have gone up
annually by seniority as now they do, _i.e._, from third Warden to
second, and so on. Those who had served as second, third, or fourth
Governors, if not chosen to higher office the next year, as a general
rule took their places again as simple liverymen; whilst those who
had served as Prime or Chief Governor were, at the expiry of their
term of office, designated “Ancient Masters,” and these, with some
past Wardens, having become qualified by experience in the affairs of
the Company would naturally be consulted by the ruling Governors who
sought their “assistance” and advice, and thus grow up into a Court
of Assistants[168] (nearly always in early time spelt “Assistance”)
and be recognised to a great extent as a power in the direction of the
Company’s business.

[168] This theory is confirmed by the Ordinances made in 1566, whereby
it was enacted that a liveryman _might_ be chosen an Assistant without
having ever served the office of Governor.

The earliest mention of Assistants is in the By-laws settled by Sir
Thomas More in 1530, though throughout these By-laws the actual ruling
power was evidently in the four Masters or Governors. The Assistants
are here twice referred to, in one case where it is enacted that the
Masters shall not admit a “fforen” to the freedom without the assent of
the “xxiiij{ti} assistentes,” and in another place they are to have,
with the Masters, the election of the Livery.

The Act 32 Henry VIII is silent as to Assistants, vesting all power
in the Masters or Governors. In 1557 at one of the Courts twenty-one
Assistants and four Masters attended, and at a Court held 19th July,
1595, the names of twenty-five Assistants are recorded. The number
seems to have varied with the times, the full Court, however, never
exceeding four Masters and thirty-two Assistants. The Assistants have
always been elected by the Court, and the custom became in time to
choose the senior liveryman whenever a vacancy occurred, though there
does not appear to have been at any time a by-law to that effect, and
indeed this practice has been departed from on very many occasions.

The Election of Masters prior to the year 1633 was on the Monday next
before the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle (Aug. 24); from 1633 to
1745 it was held on the third Thursday in August, and since 1745 it has
been held on the second Thursday in August.

The ancient practice was for the whole body of the livery to be
summoned to the Hall in their livery gowns, hoods and caps on the
Monday at 8 o’clock in the morning “at the furthest” to whom the
Masters, sitting in Court, declared the cause of their assembling;
this done, the Masters retired, and the livery, sitting there, chose
twelve of their number to be “Electors,” of whom six were to be “expert
Surgeons,” and four at least must never have served the office of
Master or Governor. The Clerk then called the twelve Electors out (the
rest of the livery remaining in the Hall). The Masters then delivered
to the Electors the “Bills of Election,” each Master nominating two
Barbers and two Surgeons, so that sixteen in all were nominated, and,
after administering to them the oath prescribed, the Electors retired
to a private room apart to make their choice. Should the Electors deem
that one or more of themselves ought to have been put in nomination,
they were to send for the Masters who were bound to withdraw such
person or persons, and choose others in their place. The Bills were to
be made out in accordance with seniority, but the Electors were not
bound to choose by seniority. Having made their choice, the Electors
sent for the Masters and delivered to them a Bill with the names of the
four persons selected, and these names were (under a heavy penalty) to
be kept secret until after the “dener.”

The whole Company then proceeded in state to the Church of St. Olave,
Silver Street (after the Great Fire to St. Alban, Wood Street), maids
strewing the way with flowers. At Church there was a “goodly masse”
celebrated, and in later times a “devyne sˀrvice,” which, being ended,
the parson and some of the church officials had customary fees and
returned with the Company to the Hall to celebrate the Election dinner.
The feast over, the outgoing Masters, according to “auncient order,”
walked about the table, each bearing a garland and placing it on the
head of the member who had been chosen to fill his place in the year
ensuing. If anyone elected happened to be absent, his garland was
placed on the head of one of the Ancient Masters as proxy, and the
newly-elected Masters were sworn on the Holy Evangelists to the due
execution of their offices, absentees being sworn at the next Court.

The Election dinners were held at any early hour in the afternoon (1
or 2 p.m.) and were generally followed by a play or a dance, sometimes
both; the wives of the livery and Assistants were present at the
dinner, and the latter had their apprentices in attendance waiting at
table.

In 1633 the mode of choosing the Electors was varied as follows: a
“fair ballating box” with two cells therein, one labelled “Surgeons”
and the other “Barbers” was placed upon the table,

    Into _each_ cell the Master put the names of
    two Ancient Masters, and drew one out of each       2

    The second and third Governors put into _each_
    cell the names of six Assistants, and the Master
    drew three out of each                              6

    The fourth Governor put into _each_ cell the
    names of four liverymen and the Master drew
    two out of each                                     4
                                                       --
                                                       12
                                                       ==

The twelve so drawn constituted the Electors, and the proceedings were
then much the same as has been before described.

The new Masters or Governors commenced their duties immediately upon
being sworn.

From the earliest period the custom has been to hold the monthly and
ordinary Courts on Tuesdays, but the meetings do not seem to have
taken place on any definite or fixed days, numerous Courts being
held at irregular intervals and frequently on Mondays. “Courts of
Assistants,” as distinguished from Monthly and special Courts, were,
in early times, for some reason or other, particularly prohibited from
being held on Tuesdays, there being several orders and by-laws to this
effect, but why, I do not know.

In the year 1557 twenty Courts were held. In 1572 forty-one Courts,
the average attendance at which was twelve. In 1599 forty-six Courts
assembled. At the intermediate Courts a great deal of important as
well as minor business was transacted, including the admissions and
presentations of freemen and apprentices, the examination of Surgeons
and Sea Surgeons, and a great variety of business connected with the
medical service of the army and navy.

Previous to the separation in 1745, the office of Master was supposed
to be, and generally was, held by a Barber and a Surgeon alternately,
the Wardens being chosen in like manner, any member not practising as
a Surgeon being accounted a Barber, whatever his trade or occupation
might be.

Great importance has at all times been attached to the question of
precedence in sitting at table and in speaking in Court, and many have
been the rules enacted, and the disputes and jealousies which have
arisen between members of the Court on this question.

Some of the powers executed by the Masters of old and by the Court
of Assistants in later times have been those which now are peculiar
to Courts of Law, _e.g._, the settlement of disputes upon every
conceivable question, the imposition of fines, and their recovery by
distress levied by the Beadle, the summary committal of offenders to
gaol, and the issuing of orders for their release, the prohibition of
actions and suits at common law (if commenced by a freeman without
leave of the Court), the inhibition of members from practising their
profession, and the infliction of corporal punishment upon unruly
freemen and apprentices.

The Court as now existing, consists of four Masters or Governors and
twenty Assistants, appointed under the provisions of the Act 18 George
II, cap. xv. By this Act the election of the Masters or Governors is
in the Court and takes place on the second Thursday in August, but
alas! without the ancient ceremonies of attending Church, crowning with
garlands, and--may I add?--the Election dinner for the Livery.

As will be seen elsewhere, there have been frequent disturbances at
the Courts, and there are numerous entries of Assistants, Wardens, and
Past Masters having been expelled the Court and sometimes dismissed
from the Livery as well, for their misconduct or quarrelsome behaviour.
Instances of impertinence and abuse by freemen and liverymen before the
Court, are also by no means rare, and in these cases condign punishment
by imprisonment or fine was invariably meted out.

  9th March, 1624. This daye Mr. Warden Thornebury made knowne to this
  Court y{t} one Tanner, a brother of this Companie, hath abused him
  in words. Whereupon it is ordered by this Court that John Bayard
  the officer belonging to this Companie shall laye the Lord Maio{rs}
  comaund on the said Tanner and comitte him to one of the Compters
  of this Cittye And that imediately upon the said comittm{t} shall

  19th January, 1626. This daye the letter directed to the Maister

  Whereas he was chosen renter warden of this Companie for this yere

  respects he is not able to execute, It is thereupon ordered by this

21st August, 1626. Serjeant Clowes was elected Master, but it seems his
election was called in question, as it was the turn for a Barber this
year, and it was moved that the electors should be fined for breach of
the ordinance in choosing a Surgeon, but the Court decided not to do
so. There was evidently a dislike to Mr. Clowes on the part of some of
the Company, as the Wardens of the Yeomanry were on the 20th September,
fined 40_s._ for refusing, or neglecting to carry the Standing Cups
before him and the Wardens of the Livery on the Election day.

1638. Serjeant Clowes was again elected Master.

  9th April, 1641. M{r} Warden Martin Browne made his complaint against
  M{r} Serjeant Clowes and he did freely declare that he did forgive
  the Serjeant his personall Wrong, and did referr the Wrong due to the
  Court unto the Court, And this Court did order that M{r} Serjeant
  Clowes shall acknowledge that in his anger and passion he did speake
  some words to the wrong of this Court, and this being done this Order
  to be annihilated.

  22nd September, 1642. Alsoe for the more peaceable treaty and

  3rd October, 1642. Alsoe M{r} Cotton layed downe his ffines imposed
  on him at the last Court of Assistants viz{t} xxvj{s} viij{d} The
  M{r} of the Company moveing by the consent of the last Court M{r}

  this Court this peremptory answer, I will not goe out of the Court
  nor the M{r} hath noe power to bidd mee goe out and that the Court
  had noe power to fine him, then he threatned M{r} Warden Arris as
  he sat in the Court saying Winter will come, Alsoe he abused M{r}
  Dye in his delivery of speech to this Court that his speeches were
  rotten speeches and thwarted him to the generall disturbance of the
  Court, and to M{r} Martin Browne threatning him I will make you know
  it better in another place Alsoe he sought to disable the M{rs} hand
  which was signed to Ticketts for his and other appearances at the

  this present Court of Assistants That M{r} Lawrence Cotton hath from
  time to time bin a disturber of the Unity peace and amity of this
  Society and hath by many reproachfull Words and ill behaviour abused
  the present M{rs} of the Company and divers of the Assistants and
  Members of this Company Whereupon this Court doth dismisse the said
  M{r} Cotton out of and from his place of an Assistant and being an

THE COMMONALTY.


The admission to membership in the Company has ever been by servitude,
patrimony, or redemption, and the fines and fees payable have varied
so much at different periods in our history, and have frequently
been so capricious, that no attempt has been made to tabulate them,
though references will be made here and there to the prevailing fees
of the period. The fees for apprentices have always been of a nominal
description, and generally so of freemen, though, in olden time,
the Court, as became the Masters of the mystery of “bleeding,” not
unfrequently bled a new member by a substantial fine on admission, but
also put him to the expense of a dinner into the bargain.

[Footnote: The initial letter T is reduced from one in the Audit Book
1614-15.]

An ample fine, suited to the period, has always been taken from
the Liverymen who were, in the days of the Tudors and Stuarts a
comparatively small section of the Company, and rarely exceeded fifty
in number; they were always chosen from the more substantial of the
Yeomanry, and if on election they refused “to take the clothing,”
as was frequently the case, a heavy penalty was imposed, which, if
not paid, the unhappy yeoman was forthwith committed to the Compter,
where, upon reflection, he generally came to the conclusion to submit.
It is right, however, to state that at all times the Court have, in
cases where the proposed Liveryman was actually a poor man, remitted
the fine, and allowed him to continue a yeoman; on the other hand,
contumacious refusal was invariably met in the firmest manner and
conquered.

The practice of calling up yeomen to the Livery was at times resorted
to as a means of putting the Company into funds, and as these calls
generally took place at periods of national trouble, when the coffers
of the Company had been emptied by the King or the Parliament, the
intended Liverymen were themselves not unfrequently in sore straits,
and great contentions arose.

About one hundred and fifty years ago the practice of enforcing these
fines was in regular operation, but since then it has been attended
with varying success; not that the Company has not by law the power of
enforcement, but a prejudice had grown up against the system, and the
Court has been unwilling to sanction a resort to extremities.

Early in the present century three or four actions were brought against
freemen to recover penalties of £20 for refusing to accept the Livery;
in one case which was ripe for trial the Company withdrew the record
and paid the costs, and the others seem to have been abandoned.

All freemen on being sworn were liable to pay “quarterage,” which has
been from the earliest period, and still is, 2_s._ per annum.[169] On
a man coming up for admission he was “presented,” that is, seen by the
Court who enquired into his position, knowledge, fitness and general
qualifications, and if approved he paid his fees and was sworn. Some of
the earlier forms of oath will be seen on reference to the Ordinances,
and that used up to a very recent period was as follows:--

[169] The quarterage is now usually compounded for on admission by
payment of a sum down.

  You shall swear That you shall be True and Loyal to our Sovereign
  Lady Queen Victoria and faithful and true in all lawful things unto
  the Corporation and Company of the Mystery of Barbers of London,
  whereof you are now made free, and accordingly be obedient to the
  Master and Governors thereof: and as much as in you lieth maintain
  amity and unity therein; and obey observe and perform all the
  lawful rules statutes and ordinances thereof; and be proportionably
  contributory to the best of your power, to all lawful or reasonable
  charges contributions and payments belonging or necessarily
  appertaining to you to bear and pay as other Brethren of the same
  Company do. And also you shall obey all manner of summons or warnings
  done, or to be made by the Clerk Beadle or other officer of the said
  Company thereunto assigned in the name of the Master and Governors,
  having no lawful or reasonable excuse to the contrary. All these
  articles you shall duly, truly, fully and faithfully observe, perform
  and keep to the best of your power. So help you God.

A few years since, this oath was changed into a declaration, the words
“You shall declare” being substituted for “You shall swear.”

It was generally the practice, when a member wished to be translated
to another Company or entirely discharged, that he should pay a fine
for his dismission. In 1724, Mr. John Bamber, a Surgeon, informing
the Court that he intended to practise as a Physician and to become a
Member of the College of Physicians prayed for his discharge, which
was granted to him on payment of thirty guineas, and there are other
entries to the like effect.

The regulations for the governance of the members are very fully
contained in the Ordinances referred to elsewhere, and it would
therefore be tedious to further allude to them here. On a perusal
of the extracts from the minutes, etc., many curious particulars
will be seen concerning both freemen and liverymen who were liable
to be expelled for not being “able” (_i.e._, solvent) and also for
not attending in their livery gowns and hoods upon summons. There
are many and often reminders to the livery to appear in their gowns
with their hoods upon their shoulders, and there are also cases in
which individuals were forbidden to wear their gowns and hoods by way
of punishment. The dress of the livery has been well described in
Herbert’s Livery Companies, and Planche’s Costume, and we can see it
in our great Holbein picture, though the dresses worn on that occasion
were of a much richer description than those in daily use.

It will be seen that the Livery were constantly going out in procession
in days of old. There were the services at St. Paul’s on Christmas and
Candlemas days, the Lord Mayor’s procession, the setting of the watch
on Midsummer Eve, the celebration of 5th November, the anniversary
of Gowrie’s Conspiracy, the Election Service at St. Olave’s, Silver
Street, days of thanksgiving and humiliation, Royal progresses and
Civic pageants. To all of these the Livery were bidden to go by
precept, and on neglect of the summons were fined. In many cases
certain of them were appointed to ride on horseback with velvet coats
and chains of gold about their necks, and when not so apparelled
they appeared in their gowns of black and scarlet, with their hoods
upon their shoulders. What would we not give for a photograph of one
of these gorgeous scenes wherein we should see the “liverie of our
solempne and grete fraternite” riding “ayenst,” say, Queen Elizabeth in
1599?

Our earlier records of freemen are unfortunately lost, the first
register commencing in the year 1551, but at Guildhall I have
discovered several admissions of freemen Barbers to the freedom of the
City, and here place a few of them upon record. The first is in 1309:--

  Thomas Orgor barbitonsor admissus fuit in libtãte civitatis & jurˀ
  &c die sabĩ pˀxima post festñ scĩ Edmundi Regis & martirˀ anno R. E.
  filˀ R. E. tcĩo coram Nich̃o de ffarendon Joh̃e de Wyndesore & Henrˀ
  de Dunolm Aldris Et dat commitati xx{s} quos pˀdcĩ Aldr̃i recepˀunt.

  (TRANSLATION.) Thomas Orgor, Barber, was admitted into the freedom of
  the City and sworn, etc., on Saturday next after the feast of Saint
  Edmund the King and Martyr in the third year of King Edward, the son
  of King Edward, before Nicholas de Farendon, John de Windsor and
  Henry de Durham, Aldermen, And gave to the Commonalty 20_s._, which
  the aforesaid Aldermen received.

Other entries are much in the same form, a few of which, abridged,
follow:--

1309. John de Dodinghurst, Barber, admitted and sworn, etc., Friday
next after the feast of St. Thomas the Apostle; paid half a mark.

1310. Ralph the Barber admitted, etc., 16th March; paid one mark.

1310. Gilbert Blaunchard, Barber, admitted, etc., 1st April; paid 10_s._

1310. Peter de Pecham, Barber, admitted, etc., 12th May, “at the
instance of Roger le Brabanzon, a justice of our Lord the King”; paid
5_s._

1310. Galfridus de Trengye, Barber, admitted, etc., Saturday before the
feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist; paid 10_s._

1311. John Syward, Barber, admitted, etc., Monday before the feast of
St. Edmund the King, at the instance of the Lord Walter, Bishop of
Winchester, Chancellor, “et ideo nichil dat ꝓ liᵬtate habenda,” “and
_therefore_ gave nothing to have the freedom!”

1312. Ralph de Bosbery, Barber, admitted, etc., on Monday in the feast
of St. Valentine; paid half a mark.

1312. John de Fynceham, Barber, admitted, etc., 6th April; paid 10_s._

1312. Henry de la Chaumbre, Barber, admitted, etc., on Monday in the
vigil of the Assumption; paid half a mark.

1312. Thomas de Mangrave who was the apprentice of Richard le Barber of
Bread Street, was admitted on Wednesday before the feast of St. James
the Apostle, on the testimony of Katherine, widow of the said Richard
and of Robert de Gloucester, the executors of his will; paid 2_s._ 6_d._

The “Richard le Barber” mentioned in the last entry was Master of the
Company in 1308.

The freemen were formerly enrolled in the “yeomanry” and formed a minor
fraternity within the Company (_see_ the chapter on the Yeomanry).

All freemen practising as journeymen or assistants, if Barbers,
Surgeons, or Barber-Surgeons were “sessed at the Hall,” that is, their
wages were settled for them by the Court, and entered in a book,
together with the period for which they agreed to serve, the period
being never less than one year nor more than three. These men were
often called “covenant servants,” but they paid quarterage, and were
entitled to all the privileges of freedom, excepting that they could
not take apprentices.

If a freemen desired to start in business, the By-laws of 1530 required
that he should prove to the Court as an act precedent to his so doing,
that he was possessed of goods to the value of ten marks.

A certain class of members called “Foreign Brothers” are very
frequently alluded to in the Books, and it has been a matter of some
difficulty to ascertain what their status exactly was, but by collation
of numerous entries I have come to the conclusion that, with very few
exceptions, they were all of them practising Surgeons, and that they
had _not_ been apprenticed to freemen of the Company. If practising
within the jurisdiction of the Company, they were compelled to join, or
else to forbear to practise, and it seems that on admission they were
required to satisfy the Court by the production of their Indentures of
apprenticeship to Country or other Surgeons that they had duly served
seven years, and to give ample proof of their skill and knowledge
before the Examiners; exceptions to the production of indentures were,
however, made in favour of those who came with recommendations from
persons of quality, or of such as had acquired eminence and position
in the profession. All sea surgeons were “Foreign Brothers” and paid a
fine (generally seven guineas) on admission, they also paid quarterage
as freemen, and when they resided within the jurisdiction were subject
to all the rules and ordinances of the Company as other freemen, being
frequently fined and imprisoned for malpractice, etc., though they were
not entitled to the benefit of the charities, to come to the dinners,
or to confer the right of admission by patrimony upon their sons, nor
do they seem to have been necessarily free of the City. Many Surgeons
practising in the Country became Foreign Brothers for the sake of the
diplomas granted at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall.

There are a few instances of “Barbers” being compelled to become
Foreign Brothers, for which I am unable to give an explanation, unless
they be errors of description by the Clerk for “Barber-Surgeons.”

Every freeman on admission formerly paid 3_s._ 4_d._, and every
apprentice on “presentation” 2_s._ 6_d._ For many years the names of
these persons are entered in the Audit Books, and thus it has been
possible to ascertain the number admitted extending over a considerable
period.

It appears that from the year 1603 to 1674, 3,479 persons were admitted
to the freedom, an average of about 48 per annum; and 9,554 apprentices
were presented, an average of about 133 per annum. The greatest number
of freemen admitted was in the year 1647 when 82 came on, and the least
in 1666 when but 23 were admitted. With apprentices the greatest number
presented was in the year 1629 when there were 219, and the least again
in the year of the Great Fire when there were but 54.

Between 1674 and 1745, about 75 freemen and 162 apprentices would be
the yearly average.

After the separation in 1745, and indeed down to the beginning of this
century, a respectable average was maintained, being about 40 freemen
and 60 apprentices per annum.

In the hundred years between 1746 and 1845, 2,964 persons were admitted
to the freedom and 4,298 apprentices were presented, being an average
of about 30 of the former and 43 of the latter for each year. The least
number of freemen coming on was in 1845, when only 5 were admitted, and
of apprentices in 1844, when but 4 were presented.

The apprentices always seem to have been a fruitful source of trouble
both to their Masters and to the Company, and numerous are the
entries of their floggings and imprisonments. The term of servitude
was generally seven years, but in a few instances it was eight and
even nine, the age at which boys were taken was usually fourteen, and
before the Indentures were sealed the boy was “presented” to the Court
that it might be seen that he was clean and not deformed or diseased.
If approved, the Indentures were executed and recorded, and in all
cases the apprentice actually lived with his Master, who covenanted
to find him meat, drink, apparel, lodging and all other necessaries
according to the custom of the City. If the boy’s master died or for
other reasons was unable to continue his business, it became necessary
for him to be “turned over” to another master, free of the Company,
and that such turn over should be approved and recorded, otherwise the
apprentice was disqualified for his freedom. When his term expired the
Master brought him to the Hall and “testified” to his faithful service,
whereupon he became entitled to the freedom on payment of a nominal
fine. Sometimes Masters refused to make their apprentices free, in
which cases the Court enquired into the circumstances, and acted in
accordance with the merits of the case.

From the earliest times the custom has prevailed to admit women to the
freedom, mostly by apprenticeship, but also by patrimony, and these
freewomen bound their apprentices, both boys and girls, at the Hall; of
course the ladies were not admitted to the livery, but otherwise they
had the same privileges as freemen so far as the same were compatible
with their sex. At the present time (1890) there is one freewoman of
the Barbers’ Company.

  demeanors And so in the pˀsents of this Court the saide appˀnts
  humbled hym upon his knees and pˀmyssed his amendment.

1567. The quarrels between masters and apprentices about this period
were numerous, and occupied a great deal of the time of the Court, who
in dealing with them generally pursued a policy of reconciliation and
made the parties friends again. In certain cases, masters were fined
for ill-treating apprentices, whilst some of the latter had their
Indentures cancelled or “torn in Court” and were either whipped or
ordered to behave better, or to find new masters.

  of Rog{r} Laborne & his wyfe and his M{r} also and he had favorable

By the next entry it would appear that Master Ralph Soda found the
society of the ladies more congenial to his tastes than the practice of
shaving and bloodletting.

  15th February, 1572. Here was Henry Lusshe and witnessed how that his

  master paynge his wages he shall serve hym.

21st July, 1573. Pecocke complained to the Court against his master
“ffor not well usinge hym in beatinge hym.”

The next is a quaint piece of dry humour--

  6th October, 1573. Here was an order taken between Danyell Botham and
  his appˀntice that he should well and trewly sˀve his M{r} and not to
  make any more complainte or trouble the M{rs} any more, and yf he do
  nott sˀve his M{r} accordyngly he shall have the Almes of the howsse.

troublesome apprentices.

  apprentyze for evyll behavio{r} by hym comytted in his masters house

Hinkesman, who received his wages instead of teaching him his trade.

20th February, 1600. Noah Bayley having been complained of for striking
his apprentice Andrew Mathew, he was fined 40_s._, and at the next
Court Mathew had license to sue Bayley at the Common law for “breaking

purpose of assisting by their fines, the fund for the building of the

THE YEOMANRY.


The Yeomanry of the Barber-Surgeons appear to have had a most chequered
existence, having been “established” and “put downe” several times,
until finally they appear to have died out both in constitution and in
name.

The Yeomanry answered exactly to the class of Members who are now
styled “Freemen,” and for a long period were the most numerous body
in the Company. In early times the numbers of the Livery or Clothing
were strictly limited, and under the Tudors and Stuarts rarely exceeded
fifty, but as the persons who were compelled to take up their freedom,
and those who came in voluntarily or by patrimony and servitude have
always been a numerous section, it appears to have been considered
politic to give a constitution to these inferior members of the
Mystery, and consequently a Yeomanry, or Company within the Company
was set up, and to this the new freeman was admitted after he had been
presented and sworn before the Masters or Governors of the Clothing.

The Court of the Company framed the Ordinances for the Yeomanry,
and whilst delegating to them many of their own privileges, as, for
instance, the power to levy fines, and to summarily commit offenders
to prison, they always seem to have retained a very tight and jealous
hand over them, and were constantly interfering with the Wardens of the
Yeomanry.

The Yeomanry had their own four Wardens and Court of Assistants, their
Beadle and mace, common box, standing cups and other silver plate,
their annual dinner, and sometimes, when in a flourishing condition, no
less than four dinners in the year, their “corrector” for apprentices,
and they also possessed the choice privilege of collecting the
quarterage from their members. Under such auspicious circumstances, it
could hardly be otherwise than that, in process of time, they should
become both presumptuous and audacious and thus provoke inevitable
collision with the Ruling body of the Company.

The Wardens of the Yeomanry at one period had designated themselves,
or certainly encouraged others to describe them, as “The Wardens of
the Barber-Surgeons,” an assumption not to be tolerated, and, like
their Masters on the Clothing, had been accustomed to go to their homes
(after their gatherings and feasts) in state, accompanied by a “trayne
or traynes”; these acts of presumption called forth the restraining
order of the 15th September, 1588 (_vide post_). Later on we find that
they went “in searche to see what serˀvnts some ffremen of the Companie
had, w{ch} they ought not to do,” they gave way to too much feasting
and arbitrarily exercised their powers of fine and imprisonment, all
which offences brought them reprimands, and somewhere about the year
1604 their temporary extinguishment. They were, however, soon after
re-erected, but in the year 1635 permanently “disestablished and
disendowed.”

Although the Constitution of the “Yeomanry” was then abolished, the
appellation was retained for over 200 years after, though merely as
a traditional distinctive name synonymous with that of “freemen.”
Thus, the whifflers for Lord Mayor’s day were always chosen out of the
“Yeomanry,” and members of the “Yeomanry” are continually spoken of as
being chosen into the Livery.

In the Audit Book, 1847-1848, this ancient term is used for the
last time in respect of the receipts for quarterage, after this the
designation becomes “freemen.”

  19th September, 1552. It is condescendyd and agreed that there shalbe
  no more yomanry of the said Company of Barbors Surgeons.

1st October, 1555. It was agreed “that the yomanrye of the sayed
Company of Barbors and Surgeons shalbe establisshed and set up agayne
and be in as full strenght force and power as ever yt was before
the plucking downe of the same,” and articles or ordinances for the
Yeomanry were enacted. As, however, these articles are excessively
verbose, the following descriptions and extracts will suffice:--

Article 1. Out of the Yeomanry were to be chosen four Wardens annually,
and named respectively, the uppermost, second, third and youngest
Wardens.

Article 2. One of the Yeomanry to be appointed Beadle of the Yeomanry
to execute summonses, etc.

Article 3. The Wardens of the Yeomanry to bring in once a year to the
Masters and Governors of the Clothing, an account of monies remaining
in their hands to be delivered to the new Wardens, and to be “kept and
bestowed as they w{t}in themselves shall thinke yt meete and convenyent
to the helpe and comforte of them w{t}in the yomanry of Barbors and
Surgeons.” The Wardens were also to present the new Wardens to the
Masters or Governors for approval within eight days after being chosen.
The Masters or Governors were to “have nothinge to dooe withe the monye
of the yomanry.”

Article 4. If the Masters or Governors should borrow any monies of the
Yeomanry they were to repay on a day to be agreed upon “the saved som̄e
so borrowed w{t} thanks geving.”

Article 5. The Wardens on the day of Election of Masters or Governors
of the Clothing shall--

  come to the dynner at the hall in their best apparrell at the daye
  appointed whiche is the mondaye senighte before Barthelmew daye, and
  when the M{r} and governors of the Clothinge doo gooe and choose the
  new M{r} and governors the cheif wardein of the yomanrye shall beare
  the cup before the M{r} The seconde wardein shall beare the cupp
  before the uppermoste governor of the clothinge. The thirde wardein
  of the yomãry shall beare the cupp before the seconde governor of the
  clothinge and the yongest wardein of the yomanry shall beare the cupp
  before the yongest governor of the clothinge in knowledging of the
  setting up of the yomanrye agayne.

In the event of sickness or lawful absence, others were to be appointed
to this duty.

  And furthermore that noen of the wardeins of the yomanrye of barbors
  and surgeons doo presume to goo aboute to make searche to see in
  anye of the Companyes houses to knowe what prentizes they have or
  journeymen as the M{r} and governors doo of the clothinge whoo have
  aucthoritie so to dooe. Yf the wardeins of the yomanry be taken or
  justelye proved that they doo soo, to forfaycte at every tyme so
  doying to the hall vj{li} xiij{s} iiij{d.}

Article 6. The Wardens of the Yeomanry were to collect the quarterage
of freemen (3_d._ per quarter) and of “fforyners” (6_d._ per quarter),
and duly pay same over to the Masters and Governors, and books of
account were to be kept by the Wardens. NOTE.--In practice this article
was varied, as the Yeomanry kept the quarterage and “compounded” with
the Masters for a fixed annual sum.

Article 7. The Masters were to pay the Wardens of the Yeomanry £4 which
had been “advanced by them in 1543 for provysyon of wheete for the
Cytie,” and which sum had been recently refunded by the City.

Article 8. The Yeomanry were to have the use of the chamber “where
the Lecture ys reade every Tewysday” whenever they please to consult
therein.

Article 9. These Articles were to be written on parchment, sealed and
delivered to the Wardens of the Yeomanry.

Article 10. The Masters were to give notice to the Wardens of the
Yeomanry of any rules which they from time to time should make touching
the craft.

Article 11. The rules and ordinances of the Company were to be read to
the Yeomanry three times in every year, viz.: at Candlemas, in May and
at Lammas.

Article 12. The Yeomanry were to obey all the rules and ordinances now
made or to be made.

16th October, 1555. The first four Wardens of the Yeomanry were
presented to the Masters, their names being Edward Hewet, John Surbut,
George Corraunte (Corron) and Thomas Buston (Burston).

12th October, 1557. It was ordered:--

  waye aboute his necessarye busynesse.

A fine of five marks was ordered to be taken from the “comon boxe” of
the yeomanry, if the above regulation should be transgressed.

  PROVIDED ALLWAYE That the sayde Wardeyns with the Rest of theyre
  assystaunce feloshyppe and Companye of the Yeomanry maye and shall
  at all Tyme and tymes decently and orderly go unto the maryagis
  offeringꝭ and Buryalls of theyre sayde Brethren and Susters of the
  sayde Company of the yeomanry as they here to fore have don.

4th July, 1566. It was ordered that the Wardens and Assistants of the
Yeomanry should be allowed to sit at the “Uppermore” table in the Hall
on quarter days to receive their quarterages, and to read the rules and
ordinances to the Yeomanry.

  18th February, 1567. IN THYS COURTE here was Edward Parke beynge[182]
  comytted to warde at the comaundment of the wardens of the yeomanry
  for his disobedyencˀs, and for his oprobrius & obstynat words in the
  pˀsents of this Courte to the M{r} & govˀnors he is comytted to warde
  agayne.

  [182] _i.e._ Having been.

18th January, 1569. At this Court seven freemen were sworn in to be
Assistants to the Yeomanry.

  15th November, 1569. In this Courte the wardens of the yeomanry
  broughte in the pˀsentꝭ of this courte John Wyllet Thom̃s Warren and
  John Jaggard & they reported y{t} Nycolas Whytemore sholde reporte
  at the thre tonnes at yeldehall gate y{t} M{r} Pole of the chauncery
  shold saye y{t} we ought to have no wardens of the yeomanry. And
  Nyc͠ols Whytemore said y{t} he was at supper at M{r} Pole & one M{r}
  Lovels & they pˀused the statutꝭ said to Whyttemore he hath ben
  warden of his cõpany & he said no he had been warden of the yeomanry
  & M{r} Pole sholde saye we cold not have a yeomanry.

  18th April, 1570. Here was John Jagger sayth that he was nevˀ a
  councell or knoleg of any pˀmoter beyng set to trouble the Company
  for the state of o{r} yeomanry And also John Wyllet denyeth the byll
  & wyll not confesse any thinge w{th}oute the pˀsentꝭ of his accuser
  but for knowledge of the pˀmotter he nevˀ meante yt he said befor
  god. And Thomas Warren saed he hathe kepte all to hymsylf & nevˀ
  mynded nor thoughte to trouble in any respecte and denyeth the byll
  also. And yt is ordered that they shall agree brotherly together and
  here after they nor any of them shall move or speake or make any
  rehersall of any matter as consernyng the state of the yeomãry upon
  payne of ip̃rysonment. And Thom̃s Warren John Wyllet & John Jagger
  shall take y{r} romes & placꝭ and brotherly they have eyther of them
  taken one a nother handes & so these matters nevˀ to be reported any
  more here after.

This brotherly amity did not long continue, for:--

  23rd May, 1570. Here was John Warren & John Wyllet is comytted to
  warde for dysobedyence, and Thomas Newens said that one Husto an
  informer his neyghbo{r} saide that the company sholde be arẽsted[183]
  upon a statute & y{t} yt is one of o{r} company did sett the enformer
  to do yt but he founde not the statute to holde w{th} them & y{r}fore
  he wolde not deale, but to name the pˀte[184] he wolde not.

  [183] _i.e._ Sued.
  [184] Party.

Warren and Wyllet must have been sent straight off to prison, as a
further minute states that on the same day “after diner,” Warren was
brought up out of the Compter for examination.

On the 29th May, Wyllet made submission and was released from prison.

19th September, 1570. Warren and Wyllet seem to have been cantankerous
brethren, for they were complained of by the Wardens of the Yeomanry
for refusing to take upon themselves the office of Wardens to which
they had been elected.

7th October, 1572. Wyllet is again complained of for going to law with
another member of the Company without license from the Masters, to
which he pleaded that under a statute 19 Henry VII, cap. viii, he could
lawfully do so. The result of this contention is not expressly stated,
though there is not the least doubt but that Wyllet revisited the
Compter, and ultimately withdrew his suit.

5th March, 1573. It was ordered--

  That where there hath ben an order that the whole bodye of the
  yeomanrye of this mysterie were compelled under a certeine fyne
  and penaltye to meet theire wardens at a certeine place by them
  appointed beinge by the beadle warned, to go to offre at the weddings
  of their brethren at all times when any of them weare married w{ch}
  was to their great trouble, and divers inconvenyences grewe thereoff
  as absence from sˀrvice and sermons one sonday mornyngs and other
  unmeate and inconvenient meetinges in steed therof. Wherefore, the
  said order was declared henceforth to be void.

  6th October, 1573. Here was a controvˀsy betweene the wardens of the
  yeomanrye that were the last yere and the Audyto{rs} of yeomanryes
  accomptes for that the Audytoures would not allowe that w{ch} was
  required by the said late wardens for bread and dryncke at theyre
  ellecc͠on Daye, the som̃e was xxvij{s} and order was taken that they
  should be allowed xvj{s} and they to beare the reste on theire owne
  chargeis and so to be ffrendꝭ and Lovers w{th} quietnes.

  6th June, 1577. Here also the wardens of the yeomanry were comaunded
  for good and urgent Cawse to bring in there graunt from the maisters
  of there yomanry against the next Co{r}te Daie for that they did take
  more Quarteridge then by the Lawe they might do and also contrary
  to there saide graunte and in breche of the same they went after a
  sort in searche to see what serˀvnts some ffremen of the Companie had
  w{ch} they ought not to do, and so yt was for that tyme let passe
  w{th} warning to do so no more and also for that they did not yerelie
  shewe there accompt w{ch} now they did and henceforth will according
  to there dutie.

  9th October, 1579. At this Co{r}te also the Wardens of the Yeomanry
  brought in their accompte before the saide masters and yt was agreed
  upon good considerac͠ons for that manye of the said yeomanrye did
  ympoverishe them selves by makinge of qr̃ter Dyners and suche
  unnecessary metinges that from henceforthe their shalbe no more
  quarter Dyners be kept in o{r} Hall by the saide yeomanrye or any of
  them but shall do as heretofore hathe ben accustomed to be don.

1587. The Yeomanry seem to have again incurred the displeasure of the
Masters, who thereupon summoned them to appear and shew cause why their
grant should not be annulled, whereupon they came on the 27th July and--

  gave their ffree and full consentꝭ that yf they have broken any pt̃e
  of their graunte to them heretofore made they will surrender upp
  their yeomanry.

10th August, 1587. The privilege of collecting quarterage was taken
away from the Yeomanry.

  Also whereas there hathe ben a Rule graunted to the yeomanrie
  that they maie send pˀsons to ward for disobedyence and to take
  ffynes yt ys fullie agreed the same Rule shalbe void But yf anie
  varyance happen to be, the same shall be declared to the masters or
  governo{rs} for Reformac͠on And further that the said yeomanrie shall
  take none into their Assystance w{th}oute the consent of o{r} saide
  masters or governo{rs} and their successo{rs.}

  7th September, 1587. M{r} Henry Rankin M{r} of o{r} Companie made a
  motyon whether he sholde swere the yeomanry or not and yf they should
  be sworne what othe he should geve them. And yt was agreed by the
  saide Corte That the Masters or Governo{rs} may take the pˀsentment
  of them but not swere them. And further yf the yeomanry do request
  to be sworne they must be answered w{th} the wordꝭ of their pattent
  w{ch} ys onlie to pˀsent them. And further touching the collecc͠on
  of their quartridge yt must stand as yt dothe untill further
  consultac͠on be had therein and yf they have any request to make or
  ought to saie they must bring the same in writinge into this Corte.

  29th May, 1600. This daie the wardens of the yomanrye made requeste
  to the Maisters that they woulde be pleased to redeliver unto them
  their booke of orders which remayneth in their Custodie, whereuppon
  it is not thoughte fitt by the Courte that the yeomanrie have the
  Custodie of the said booke, but that the Clarke of this Companye
  keepe the same And that he shewe the same booke to the yeomanrye when
  they have occasion to use it.

About two years previously the Court had endeavoured to put down the
Yeomanry and had curtailed many of their privileges; the exact nature
of the disagreement is not stated, but it doubtless arose from the
Yeomanry “takeinge to much uppon themsyllfs.”

  17th January, 1604. At this Courte it is ordered That the Ould
  Wardens of the Yomanrye doe bringe in such money as is behind by
  theire Audite beinge eight pounds twelve shillings and eight pence
  ORELLS to be committed to the Compter.

28th February, 1605. It was ordered that a Yeomanry of this Company
should be established, though there is no entry of its extinguishment.
Rules and ordinances were to be made by the Court, and twenty-four
persons were to be nominated by the “present wardens of the said
Yeomanry” to serve as a Court of Assistants for the Yeomanry, with a
power of veto reserved to the Masters.

16th April, 1605. A Committee sat to consider the patent to be granted
to the Yeomanry.

  2nd May, 1605. This daye the M{r} and M{r} Warden Mapes and M{r}
  Thorney delivˀed to the Wardens of the yomanry viz. Robert Jenninges
  and Richard Alderson and also to Robert Wood and Edward Goodale the
  yomanryes boxe and money their Corrector their twoe standinge Cuppes
  & Covers and their cases and all such oth{r} thinges as they had of
  the yomanryes, but onely their patent w{ch} is to be renued & twoe of
  their keyes were delivˀed to the sayd Robert Wood and Edward Goodale
  by them to be kept.

  24th May, 1605. This daye the ordynancꝭ of the yomanry were ratiefied
  & confirmed by this Court. Also the quarterages of the yomanry was
  this daye demised unto the wardens of the yomanry from the xvj{th}
  of September next ensuinge for the terme of ... at the yerely rent
  of 8{li} to be paid by quarterly payments w{ch} demyse was passed by
  wrytinge indented as by the same more at lardge may appeare.

At the end of the Minute Book, 1598-1607, is a copy of a part of this
indenture.

26th November, 1607. It was ordered:--

  That the wardens of the yomanry shall take for the use of their
  funerall clothe at eˀvy funerall wherein it is used ij{s} vj{d} And

  10th August, 1609. It was ordered that the Yeomandry shall hold their
  great generall dinner albeit they made request to the Contrary.

The next extracts record the last events in the chequered existence of
the Yeomanry.

  17th November, 1635. According to a former order of Court the
  Wardeins of the yeomanrye did this daye deliver up unto the Maisters
  their Accompt and the xvij{li} v{s} viij{d} in money upon the foote
  of that Accompt Also they delivered up to this Court their plate

THE CLERK.


The office of Clerk of the Company is doubtless as ancient as the
Company itself, although there is no mention of one prior to the year
1530[185]; but as there were always registers to be kept, fees to
receive, apprentices to bind, and the multifarious business of a Livery
Guild to conduct and record, we conclude that the office has existed
from the earliest period.

[185] In the ordinances of Sir Thos. More.

The Clerk in Queen Mary’s time seems to have combined the occupation of
gardener with that of his office, and for this he had but a small fee
in addition to his stipend. Later on the Clerks appear to have devised
fees for every conceivable kind of business which could possibly
be transacted at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, and in the 17th and 18th
centuries the income derived from this source alone must have been very
considerable.

The Company has been served by good, bad and indifferent Clerks; we
prefer to dwell only on the former and record the names among others,
of Francis Rowdon, Charles Bernard and John Paterson as being worthy
to be held in goodly remembrance. The books of the Company abound in
testimony to their ability as well as to the fidelity and zeal which
they displayed in the execution of their office.

1st October, 1555. The first Clerk of whom there is any record is
Thomas Apulton (or Apleton), who, being Beadle, was promoted to that
office.

As will be seen elsewhere, the Company had a fair garden in Monkwell
Street, and the following interesting minute connects it with the
Clerk:--

  8th October, 1555. The Clercke of our Companye shall have for waxe
  pennes and ynke and for trymynge of the gardeyn yerelye vj{s}
  viij{d.} Yf the gardeyn be not well trymmed and made clene weded and
  swept at all tymes when the M{r} and Governors of the clothing or
  any of Thassistaunce of the same shall see yt and thereupon fynde
  faulte then the saide Clercke shall paye a ffyne to the hall because
  the said gardein ys not made cleane swept and wedyd as the M{r} and
  Governors of the Clothinge and thassistaunce of the same shall think
  meete and convenyent.

5th March, 1556. It was ordered that if--

  The Clercke of the Company doo evile mysuse any of the Clothinge or
  of the yomanry w{th} unsemely words & dewe proofe therof had and
  proved he shalbe dismyssed clere from the having of the Office of
  clercke.

27th August, 1557. John Johnson was elected and sworn Clerk “for so
longe time as he shal behave hymsyllfe well and honestlye in the saide
office.” The salary was fixed at £4 per annum, with 6_s._ 8_d._ extra
for paper, ink and keeping the garden, and “for wasshinge of the lynen
of the howse iij{s} iiij{d.}”

It would appear that one Wilson had some time previously been Clerk,
for arrangements were made by which Wilson’s widow was not to be put
out of her house, and it was also settled that if Johnson died before
his wife, his widow should in like manner have the house after his
decease. The rent of this house, which was attached to the Hall was
10_s._ per annum, and paid by the Clerk to the Renter Warden.

Johnson probably continued Clerk till about 1570, as the books are kept
in the same handwriting until then.

Thomas Garter succeeded Johnson, but on 14th January, 1572, he was
dismissed from his office for a “certain lewde facte by him committed,”
and William Field was elected and sworn in in his place. Field wrote an
exceedingly neat and precise hand.

20th March, 1572. It was ordered that in future the Clerk of the
Company should always be chosen from among the freemen.

15th March, 1575. William Eden elected Clerk vice Field.

14th November, 1577. Eden was ordered to receive £6 per annum
“benevolence” over and above his salary of £4, in consideration of the
“smalenes of his lyvinge.”

10th December, 1596. Eden was indebted to the Company £10, “yet in
regard of the hardnes of the tyme and his greate charge he shalbe
forborne this yere.” At the same Court, gifts were made to the Beadle
and Porter on account of the hardness of the times.

16th June, 1597. Eden’s troubles had not forsaken him for we read under
this date--

  There was geven unto Willm̃ Eden Clark of the Companie in regard of
  his greate charge and the scarsytie of the tyme the some of v{li}
  and for the x{li} w{ch} he oweth he ys to pay the same as god shall
  inable him.

2nd November, 1597. Francis Rowdon elected Clerk vice Eden. Rowdon
appears to have been a most methodical man and kept the books with
scrupulous neatness and care; his writing is a very fine specimen of
the Court hand of the period, and the best in the Company’s books for
many years.

1599. The Clerk’s Salary was raised to £6 per annum.

1600. To £8 per annum, and in

1603 To £10 per annum.

  6th July, 1609. Uppon the humble suite & petic͠on of ffrancꝭ Rowdon
  Clarke to this Company It is this daye ordered by this Courte that
  w{th}in one moneth next ensuinge hee shall noĩat to the pˀnt M{rs} a
  sufficient Clarke to whom hee is desyreous to surrender his place and
  office of Clark to this Company And his suite shalbe graunted unto
  him if such pˀson so to be pˀnted unto this Court shalbe lyked and
  allowed.

26th July, 1609. Rowdon presented Richard Ratsdale, Scrivener, for the
office of Clerk, about whose sufficiency and ability enquiries were
ordered to be made, but they were not satisfactory, for, on the 10th
August, William Syddon was elected Clerk vice Rowdon.

The same day it was ordered that Rowdon was to continue in the Livery
and to have the use of the Hall and his house until Michaelmas, also
that Syddon was to be translated from the Cutlers’ Company.

Syddon’s records of the Company’s business were very meagre and a great
contrast to those of the former Clerk.

7th October, 1625. Syddon surrendered his clerkship to Richard Turner
(a son of Cressens Turner, Clerk in the Lord Mayor’s Court), who
was admitted and sworn. Turner died in 1643, and by his will left
some property to the Company to be annually distributed in charity
amongst freemen of the Barber-Surgeons, and this became the source
of a protracted litigation between his widow and the Company. On the
17th November, 1643, she filed a bill against the Company, which
they defended, and succeeded in retaining the greater portion of the
bequest. The accounts appear to have been very intricate and involved,
remaining unsettled for many years. The Court, however, distributed
the whole of the bequest in accordance with the will, as long as the
estate (which was leasehold) held out.

  16th June, 1628. It is ordered by this Court and our M{r} gave order
  to the Clarke that he should henceforward have a stoole and sitt at
  the end of the table w{th} his bookes and register as the clarkes of
  other Companies doe.

2nd October, 1643. Robert Rawlins elected Clerk vice Turner.

30th June, 1648. The Court granted Rawlins £30 in consideration of his
great pains about the Company’s business, and ordered that his salary
should be raised from £10 to £30 per annum.

23rd February, 1658. Richard Reynell elected Clerk vice Rawlins
(resigned).

21st July, 1685. Joseph Masters elected Clerk.

17th September, 1685. Charles Hargrave elected “Deputy Clerk.” The
business of the Company had of late years increased enormously in
consequence of the examinations of and Certificates to Navy Surgeons,
examinations held for superannuation of wounded or infirm soldiers and
sailors, and other matters connected with the Navy office, all of which
entailed vast labour on the Clerk.

28th November, 1688. Charles Hargrave elected Clerk vice Masters.

20th November, 1707. Charles Bernard elected Clerk vice Hargrave.

Hargrave had kept the books in a slovenly manner, and appears to have
been both a dishonest servant as well as an improvident man.

11th December, 1707. It was reported to the Court that Hargrave’s
Estate was indebted to the Company £320 8_s._ 6_d._, moneys which he
had received and not accounted for.

8th July, 1708. Mrs. Sarah Hargrave (his Widow) presented a petition
for relief, stating that she was in poor circumstances, with six
children unprovided for, whereupon the Court, notwithstanding her late
husband’s delinquencies, very generously ordered her a gratuity of £12
10_s._ 0_d._

Charles Bernard was a relative of, and Executor to Charles Bernard,
Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen Anne and Master in 1703. It is delightful
to observe the methodical and careful manner in which Bernard began,
and all through his life kept the books and accounts; he wrote a large
and elegant hand, though somewhat encumbered with flourishes, and his
signature is a characteristic one.

[Illustration: Handwritten signature]

7th September, 1708. Hargrave’s son was in the Compter, and the Clerk
was directed to see and talk with him about the Company’s papers in
his custody, and if he would give them up the Clerk was to make him a
present of three guineas.

The Court frequently relieved Mrs. Hargrave, and in December, 1709,
gave her £15.

Among the official list of Clerk’s fees at this period were the
following:--

    For the use of the Hall for ffuneralls, Country ffeasts
      or weddings                                                1 0 0

    ffor the ffunerall of every Liveryman, the best hood or      0 7 0

  17th July, 1718. The Court as a particular reward to Charles Bernard
  their Clerk for abstracting and peruseing the Company’s title to
  the Estate in East Smithfield and for his care in passing the fine
  thereof whereby the Company saved a sume of money and for his
  extraordinary trouble in attending the Lords of the Admiralty and
  prosecuteing several persons for takeing the dead bodys from the
  place of Execuc͠on Did and do hereby give him the sum̄e of fourscore
  pounds who accepted the same as a most bountifull Instance of the
  kindness of this Court to him with a full resoluc͠on on his part to
  acquitt himself by all imaginable and constant returns of duty and
  gratitude.

Mr. Charles Bernard, who had been a most zealous Clerk and high in the
esteem of the Court, died somewhere between the 5th and 20th February,
1740.

25th March, 1740. Joseph Wheeler, son of John Wheeler, Barber-Surgeon,
elected Clerk, vice Bernard. Wheeler wrote a fine bold and flowing
hand; and the books were well kept, but he was evidently not so able a
man as Mr. Bernard.

4th July, 1740. Joseph Wheeler provided two sureties who entered into a
bond for £3,000, to ensure his fidelity in the execution of his office.

17th January, 1743. The Commissioners of the Navy having complained
that sufficient regard had not been paid to former letters of theirs
respecting Surgeons’ Mates, and it appearing that the Clerk had
withheld the said letters from the Court, it was ordered that he should
be suspended forthwith, with which the Commissioners were acquainted
and also that the Court had resolved not to take off such suspension
but by the consent and desire of the Commissioners.

31st January, 1743. The Commissioners of the Navy having signified
their desire that the Clerk should be restored to his office, he was
called into Court, severely reprimanded, reinstated in his position,
and cautioned as to his future conduct.

Mr. Wheeler continued Clerk until the separation of the Surgeons from
the Barbers in 1745, when neither body retained his services, and it
appearing that moneys were due from him to the Company, application was
made to his sureties.

25th June, 1745. John Paterson was chosen Clerk to the Barbers’ Company
at the first Court held after the separation, and entered into a Bond
with two sureties in a sum of £2,000.

19th February, 1746. Mr. Paterson having brought in an account of his
Costs in the matter of the separation of the Surgeons amounting to £167
13_s._ 2_d._, and also an account of voluntary contributions by members
of the Company towards defraying the same amounting to £168 10_s._
6_d._, he begged the Court to accept of his past services as a return
for the honour done him in his election, and the Court were pleased
to accept of the compliment, but having a high sense of the services
rendered by Mr. Paterson, they directed the sum of £80 to be laid out
in plate and presented to him “to remain in his family as a memorial of
his merit and of their gratitude.”

5th March, 1765. Mr. Paterson requested permission to resign his
office, which the Court accepted with great reluctance, and passed a
complimentary resolution in his favour.

Richard Beale, who had been Mr. Paterson’s clerk and was highly
recommended by him, was elected Clerk.

8th August, 1765. Mr. Paterson was unanimously elected an Assistant.

Mr. Beale bequeathed £500 to the Company in reversion on the death of
Mrs. Ann Woodhouse.

22nd April, 1766. James Marye elected Clerk vice Beale (deceased).

  22nd April, 1766. John Paterson Esquire being withdrawn a Motion was
  made and the question being put That a piece of plate of the value of
  Fifty Pounds or thereabouts be presented to the said M{r} Paterson
  as a mark of the high esteem and value this Court entertains of his
  merit and abilities and to shew their gratitude to him for his long
  and faithful services during the course of twenty years and in return
  for his readiness on every occasion to assist this Court with his
  advice and council, the same was carried in the Affirmative, NEMINE
  CONTRADICENTE.

By the Accounts for this year it appears that a Silver Tureen, Dish and
Ladle were purchased for £65 16_s._ 0_d._, and this was no doubt the
gift to Mr. Paterson.

20th August, 1767. The Court being informed that Mr. Paterson intended
to stand for the City at the next General Election, it was ordered that
he should have the use of the Company’s Hall for his meetings.

An excellent mezzotint portrait of Mr. Paterson, with some eulogistic
lines below, is preserved at Barbers’ Hall.

In 1754 Mr. Paterson presented to the Company the valuable portrait of
the Duchess of Richmond, painted by Sir Peter Lely, and which still
adorns the Court Room.

Mr. Paterson was a member of the Common Council, and sometime
Chairman of the Bridge House Estates Committee, he was also M.P. for
Ludgershall, Wilts. He was ever faithful to this Company, serving it
with distinguished ability, and seems to have been greatly respected
and esteemed.

1st June, 1790. William Wood elected Clerk vice Marye.

Mr. Wood presented the Company with a handsome Silver Tea Urn.

13th August, 1795. Edward Grose Smith (Mr. Wood’s partner) elected
Clerk vice Wood, resigned.

5th March, 1822. Henley Smith (son of E. G. Smith) elected Clerk vice
Smith, resigned.

5th February, 1861. Mr. Henley Smith resigned and was elected an
Assistant (Master in 1864).

7th May, 1861. Henley Grose Smith (son of Henley Smith) elected Clerk
vice Smith, resigned. Mr. Henley Grose Smith was elected an Assistant
1877.

THE BEADLE.


There is no certainty as to the first institution of this office,
though it is probably not so old as that of the Clerk, who in ancient
times, summoned the Livery, collected the quarterage and performed
various duties which we afterwards find assigned to the Beadle, and we
may conclude that in those days he was little more than a Caretaker or
“Porter”; indeed, this is the more likely as the latter designation is
frequently applied to the Under Beadle in the Records.

As the business and numbers of the Company increased, several minor
functions of the Clerk were delegated to the Porter or Beadle, who had
distinctive duties assigned to him varying with the age in which he
lived; among these may be enumerated, sweeping the garden, collecting
quarterage, cleaning the Hall, whipping naughty apprentices, summoning
freemen, etc., bringing home dead bodies from Tyburn, keeping lists of
journeymen, pressing Surgeons and Barbers for sea service, assisting
the Masters on search days, hunting up and laying informations against
non freemen practising Barbery and Surgery, marshalling and heading
processions, both at the Hall and in the City pageants, guarding the
Parlour door, and other offices too numerous to particularise, though
there were but few of them which did not yield a fee, and indeed our
Beadle could hardly have lived without fees, for his official salary
in Edward VI’s time was but £4 per annum, which, notwithstanding the
greater value of money then, could scarcely be considered a fat living.

With one exception, the office has been (and properly so) held by
freemen, and in the appointment of the Court. In 1626, however, the
Lord Keeper sent a letter “recommending” (_i.e._, commanding) the
Company to elect one Gorton, a servant of his, to the place, and Gorton
was accordingly chosen. The interference of the King and his great
officers in the patronage and appointments vested in the City guilds
was carried to great lengths with some of the Companies, and there are
amusing accounts extant of the astuteness with which this meddling was
sometimes met (_vide_ Herbert’s Livery Companies). Our Company, with
the solitary exception above referred to, appears to have been happily
free from this species of intervention.

Early in the 17th century there were two Beadles of the Clothing, the
Under Beadle being often styled the Porter, but about the middle of the
18th century, and since then, one Beadle has sufficed.

The Beadle has always had his “house” at the Hall, and used formerly
to pay a small quit rent for it. On the dismission of a Beadle for
misconduct, a difficulty was sometimes experienced in regaining
possession of this house, and various shifts were resorted to;
even the Beadles’ Widows now and then refused to turn out, and the
“benevolences” meted out to them were possibly sometimes in the nature
of bribes to induce them to go.

Besides the Beadles of the Clothing, there was a Beadle of the
Yeomanry, whose duties were analogous to those of his more exalted
brethren, and into whose office he frequently stepped when there was a
vacancy.

The Beadles for many years had a most disagreeable duty to perform,
namely, the procuring and bringing home from Tyburn the dead bodies
of malefactors. By the Act 32 Hen. VIII, the Company were empowered
to have yearly the bodies of four executed felons for “anatomies,”
and the practice was for the Beadles to attend at the gallows and
select such bodies as they pleased. Their opponents were generally the
hangman, who himself trafficked in these uncanny goods, the relatives
of the criminal, and the populace who were incited by the relatives
to resist the Beadles. Many were the unseemly fights which took place
over these bodies, and oftentimes when the Beadles had secured a
“subject” and were driving off with it in a coach, they were attacked
and beaten, and the body rescued from them. The hangman appears to
have been entitled to the dead man’s clothes, for on more than one
occasion the Company gave him compensation for them, they having been
torn to pieces in the brutal struggle for possession. Moreover the
Company had often to satisfy the Coachmen for personal injuries and
for damages to their coaches, as well as to give special gratuities to
their Beadles by way of solatium for the beatings which they underwent.
Frequent prosecutions and convictions followed the interference with
the Company’s Officers at these times, and even the Sheriff’s Officers
were on one occasion dismissed by the City for having sided against the
Beadles.

The hangman came to the Hall regularly for his Christmas Box and gave a
receipt for the same, sometimes affixing the title “Executioner” after
his signature. Many curious particulars relating to the above will be
found elsewhere. (_Vide_ Wardens’ Accounts, Surgery, etc.)

[Illustration: Mace]

The Beadle is elected annually by the Court, and resides at the Hall.
The two Silver maces pertaining to his office are as handsome and
massive as any in the City and are always carried before the Master on
Court days.

14th May, 1530. The earliest reference to the Beadle in our Records is
to be found in the Ordinances signed by Sir Thomas More, where it is
directed that the Members shall take their seniority “according to the
trew entrance therof in the Bedyllꝭ Rolle.”

6th November, 1550. Richard Wilson was Beadle at this time.

6th July, 1552. Thomas Appulton, Beadle, vice Wilson deceased.

19th September, 1552. It was agreed that Appulton “shall have his messe
of meate on the feaste dayes.”

  4th May, 1574. Here was the Wardens of the yeomanry and brought
  Anthony Hall in to the Courte to be admytted Beadle of the yeomanrye
  and he was sworne and admytted and fathe(r) Roger(s) put to his
  penc͠on and to geve attendaunce but as he is able.

22nd July, 1577. Richard Rogers, the old Beadle of the Yeomanry, was
ordered a gift of 20_s._ and a yearly pension of 20_s._

23rd July, 1582. Robert Norton, Yeomanry Beadle, was authorised to take
2_d._ of every freeman on his admission, and his yearly salary of 8_s._
was raised to 26_s._ 8_d._

14th August, 1587. Robert Norton was Livery Beadle.

10th December, 1596. James Hewes (Hughes) was Livery Beadle.

15th August, 1603. Kellam Clifton appointed Porter or Under Beadle.

21st July, 1608. Edward Blayny, Beadle, was dismissed for behaving

subsequently reinstated.

19th February, 1621. Clifton, again misbehaving himself, was dismissed.

14th June, 1621. Humphry Mumford elected Beadle.

3rd July, 1621. Chapman, the Porter, dismissed for using “lewd
speeches,” but on his humble submission and craving pardon on his
knees, he was reinstated, 10th July, 1621.

20th August, 1621. The Company could not get Clifton out of his house,
so they gave him 20_s._ and a pension of 40_s._ per annum during good
behaviour and the pleasure of the Court. Possibly the “pleasure of the
Court” did not extend beyond one year.

15th February, 1626. Edward Gorton (recommended by the Lord Keeper)
elected Beadle in place of Mumford.

  10th July, 1628. This daye this Court takeing notice of an order
  made the 3 of Julye, 1621, by w{ch} order Chapman our Porter for his
  dissolute and deboist carriage was ip̃o facto then by that order
  dismissed of his said place and likewise of an order made in the
  beginning of oure M{rs} tyme for the dismissing of the said Chapman
  for his misbehavior and upon the generall complaint made unto this
  Court against the said Chapman for the most parte being drunck
  misbehaveing himselfe towardꝭ the M{rs} and carrieing himselfe soe
  basely & quarrelsome to the brethren of this Companie and neglecting
  his duety to this house. It is thereupon ordered that he shall stand
  dismissed from his said place unlesse at the next Court of Assistantꝭ
  it doe appeare that he hath left his former carriage of being often
  drunck & deboistnes.

3rd February, 1634. Gorton requested to be discharged of his office of
Beadle in respect of his age and feebleness, and Nathaniel Foster was
elected in his place.

25th January, 1637. Chapman, “Under Beadle,” resigned, and was assigned
a pension of £4 per annum during pleasure.

25th January, 1637. Edmond Johnson “who writeth very well” was elected
Under Beadle.

6th March, 1639. Foster, for his “sawcey carriage unto this Companie”
and general neglect of duty, was dismissed.

1659. Francis Johnson was Beadle with a salary of £10, and Peter Smith,
Porter, with a salary of £8.

1662. Peter Smith was Beadle, and Thomas Veere, Porter.

23rd June, 1692. Ordered that William Cave be admitted to assist Peter
Smith and Jonas Wills the Beadles.

19th July, 1694. Peter Smith was dead; he had been a very zealous
servant of the Company. On the first floor landing at the Hall is a
pretty piece of heraldic glass in the window with his name and the date
1671. Jonas Wills elected Beadle.

16th August, 1694. William Cave elected Beadle vice Wills deceased.

8th July, 1708. William Cave and Thomas Repton were Beadles.

6th July, 1710. Repton’s widow had £3 given her to bury her late
husband.

20th February, 1711. Mr. Gratian Bale (son of Nathan Bale, Citizen
and Grocer) who was apprenticed 22nd June, 1669 to Robert Andrewes
(Surgeon), and afterwards became an Examiner in Surgery, and Master in
1709, petitioned the Court to be relieved of the office of an Assistant
on the ground that he had fallen into decayed circumstances and could
not possibly support that dignity, and on his resignation being
accepted, the Court proceeded to the election of a Beadle in the room
of Thomas Repton deceased, whereupon Mr. Bale was elected--

  And in regard that the s{d} M{r} Bale had been Ma{r} of This Company
  This Court doth hereby give him leave (asking the consent of the
  Governo{rs} for the time being) to depute some other person to walke
  before the Company in his stead with the Beadles staffe & gowne upon
  the Lord Mayors & Elecc͠on days.

18th May, 1714. Mr. Bale having become too infirm to execute his
office, the Court, in consideration of his past services, appointed
William Hardy, Barber, his assistant, at a salary of £10 per annum.

31st July, 1716. William Cave died of a “high fever.”

16th August, 1716. William Watkins and William Hardy elected Beadles,
on condition of paying Mr. Bale £10 per annum, which the Court
supplemented with another £10.

10th July, 1717. Richard Collins elected Beadle vice Hardy, deceased.

18th August, 1720. It was ordered that in future no man could be
qualified to be put in nomination for the office of Beadle if above 40
years of age--

  in order that the business may from thenceforward be discharged and
  dispatched with propˀ vigour and dexterity and to the honour and
  profitt of the Company.

13th April, 1721. Watkins being so indisposed as not to be able to
perform his duties, Charles Window (who looked after the dead bodies at
Tyburn) was ordered to officiate for him. Watkins shortly after lost
his speech and got into Ludgate prison, where he had a weekly allowance
from the Company--he seems to have remained in prison till his death,
3rd August, 1724.

7th October, 1722. Henry Gretton elected Beadle vice Watkins.

6th November, 1724. Matthew Morris elected Beadle vice Collins,

Dr. J. J. Howard had in his collection the following document, which,
as he says, affords good evidence of the low condition of Surgical
practice in the metropolis at the accession of Elizabeth.

Surgeon in his day and wrote “An Historiall Expostulation Against the

The following order for the erection of raised seats for the members
attending the Anatomy lectures, and for a screen to temporarily hide
the body, indicates the growing interest taken by the Company in the
furtherance of technical education; and from the reference to _the_
skeleton, for which a case was directed to be made, it is highly
probable that this was the only specimen which the Company in those
days possessed!

Surgeons were continually being called before the Court for “evil
dealing” with their patients, and for not performing cures for which
they had received the money beforehand. The Court generally endeavoured

  same booke or bookes be first presented unto the masters governors
  and examenors of this Companie for the tyme beinge upon payne of
  x{li.}

The following order was doubtless directed against a prevalent mania
for relics of notorious criminals.

  17th July, 1578. That no pˀson or pˀsons of this Companie do presume
  at anie tyme or tymes hereafter of Anathomies to take and carrie

recommended that persons using Barbery should not practise Surgery, the
Master and Governors went to Guildhall, and there promised the Court of
Aldermen that they would compel all their free Barbers to enter into

cum morbo gallico,” and accordingly the Barbers entered into bonds to
that effect.

In Stow’s Annales, ed. 1592, p. 1261, is the following remarkable
account of a “subject” coming to life again at our hall.

  1587. The 20 of Februarie, a strange thing happened a man hanged for
  felonie at Saint Thomas Wateringes, being begged by the Chirurgions
  of London, to have made of him an Anatomie, after hee was dead to
  all mens thinking, cut downe, stripped of his apparell, laide naked
  in a chest, throwne into a carre, and so brought from the place
  of execution through the Borough of Southwarke over the bridge,
  and through the Citie of London to the Chirurgions Hall nere unto
  Cripelgate: The chest being there opened, and the weather extreeme
  cold hee was found to be alive, and lived till the three and twentie
  of Februarie, and then died.

It was doubtless the above circumstance, to which reference is made
in the next minute; it would seem that the body had been begged by
some surgeons and taken to the hall to be dissected there, it being
unlawful to dissect elsewhere, and that on the resuscitation of the
unhappy man, the Company had been put to some expenses whereupon they
made an order to provide for any similar case in the future. This body
would be what is often referred to in the Books as a “private anatomy,”
in opposition to the four “public” bodies of felons to which the
Company were annually entitled.

  13th July, 1587. Iˀtm yt ys agreed That yf any bodie w{ch} shall at
  anie tyme hereafter happen to be brought to o{r} Hall for the intent
  to be wrought uppon by Thanatomistes of o{r} Companie shall revyve
  or come to lyfe agayne as of late hathe ben seene The charges aboute
  the same bodie so revivinge shalbe borne levied and susteyned by such

and delivered into his Captain’s charge, and four or five other
Surgeons were also pressed and handed over _nolens volens_. One of

  Then he was demaunded by what authoritie he did practice Surgery to
  w{ch} he aunswered he had sufficient authoritie for he was allowed by
  the Archbusshop of Canterburie and the Busshop of London Then M{r}
  ffenton demaundinge of him in what busshops tymes he was so admitted,

  aunswered he was admitted by Busshop Whiteguift. Then was demaunded

  ~Right~ Hono{ble} According unto yo{r} Lõps reference unto us
  directed dated the second of November 1627 ~Wee~ have taken a
  deliberate vewe of the supposed monstrous birth presented unto us to
  be vewed as from your hono{r} by one Humfrey Bromley And although
  wee cannot possitively affirme it proceeded not from a woeman Yet
  under favor, wee conceive and soe deliver our opinions that the said
  supposed monstrous shape hath beene, either by Arte soe composed
  and put together from unnaturall and untimely birthes of Children
  or from other Animalls, as Apes, Munckeys or the like w{ch} have a
  greate resemblance of Manns bodye, in many of their partes and soe
  by the cunninge subtiletye of the composer made into a monster,
  thereby to delude the worlde and haveing a Bodye of Antiquitie cannot
  safely receive a flatt and manifest contradiction; And wee are
  induced the rather to suspect it for that the producer thereof hath
  noe testimonye from any learned or judicious men; neither from any
  Magistrates of the partes where it is pretended to have bene borne,
  w{ch} such offendors use aboundantly to be furnished withall. And in
  conclusion compareing his printed demonstrac͠on of his monster, with
  the Author he siteth, and others that have written of such and the
  like monsters, Wee finde a greate deale of Addition and a manifest
  disagreem{t} w{ch} is a playne badge of fixion and falsehoode. All
  w{ch} our opinions wee humbly submitt to yo{r} hono{rs} grave wisdome
  to be further considered of.

I interfering in Scotch Church matters, broke out, and a large army
being collected in the North the Barber-Surgeons were directed to
“press” and forward twenty-three Surgeons to Newcastle.

The Minute relating to this is as follows,--

  20th April, 1639. Upon reading the warr{t} sent to this house from
  Yorke signed by the Lord Generall concerneing the want of Surgians in
  the Armye It is concluded by the Governo{rs} & Assistants here pˀnte
  that M{r} Warden Dunn & M{r} Collins shall goe on, & goe aboard some
  Newcastle shipp and agree with a shipper for y{e} conveighance of
  y{e} Surgians & their Chests & provisions & their mates, & likewise
  give them conduct money, & that for the present that charge to be
  borne out of the stock of this house untill it cann be reobteyned
  from the Thrẽr of y{e} Armye.

This appears to have cost the Company £44 14_s._, whereof they
received but £23, the balance never having been paid. The details
of the expenditure are subjoined, and in reading them we cannot but
commiserate the unhappy men who were barged to Gravesend and thence
“transported” to Newcastle.

In accordance with their Charters the ancient practice of the Company
had been to elect annually two Surgeons and two Barbers for Master
and Wardens; this fell into electing two Surgeons and two others
who were often neither Barbers nor Surgeons, and latterly, even the
qualification of Surgery came to be disregarded, whereupon (29th March,
1639) a mandate, signed by Charles I and directed to the Company, was
read in Court (see Appendix, G) in which the King set forth that divers
persons as “hosiers dyers & other tradesmen unskilfull in Chirurgery
or Barbarye” had been chosen for Masters and Wardens contrary to
the Charters and Acts of Parliament, and further “wee takeing into
considerac͠on of what dangerous consequence it maye be to suffer a
Companye wherein the lives and safetie of o{r} people are soe much
concerned and for w{ch} o{r} progenitors have soe carefully provided to
be governed by such unskilfull pˀsons,” the King straitly commanded
the Company to elect the Governors in the future as they ought to do,
viz.: two Barbers and two Surgeons each year.

This order of the King appears for some little time to have been
obeyed, and then the Company relapsed into their old practice of
choosing at their pleasure, whereupon another mandate came from the
King, for we find that:--

17th January, 1644. The Court took notice of the King’s mandate, and
a very long and elaborate minute is entered to the effect that the
practice of choosing two Barbers and two Surgeons for Governors was
fraught with much inconvenience and had led to great dissensions, and
the Court referring to the Statute of Henry VII, where it is allowed
that any person free of the Company following any other profession than
that of a Barber or Surgeon should be reputed and taken as a Barber,
ordered that for the future, any Member of the Assistants, other than
a Barber or Surgeon, might be put in nomination, and that he should
be accounted a Barber. The Court were very careful to express their
loyalty to the King whilst they ignored his mandate, trusting no doubt,
that should they afterwards be called to account by the King, their
dutiful expressions towards him would serve in a measure as an excuse
for disobeying his express commands.

  [Sidenote:
  Mould for y{e}
  Kings Evill.]

  2nd July, 1639. Anthony Mould called to this Court and questioned
  concerneing his practise in Surgerye, confessed that he deales onely
  in swellings and Kernills & hath a licence from the Kinge to practise
  the same, he hath lately taken into his Cure one George Ravenscroft
  for scrophilous tumo{rs} in the neck, this Court at the said Moulds
  request, hath given libertye to Mould to cure him by Michaelmas next,
  & he hath promised then to present the said Geo: whole & well to this
  Court.

Some nine years afterwards Mould was again before the Court in a case
of King’s evil.

  21st March, 1648. Henry Ivatt complayned against Anthony Mold for
  his evill practice On the Wife of the said Ivatt who being afflicted
  with the Kings Evill Whereof he undertooke to cure her And for that
  purpose did receive of the said Ivatt xxx{s} in hand and was to have
  40{s} more when she was cured Both partyes refeered themselves to
  this Court Whereupon this Court doth Order That the said Mold doth
  restore xx{s} back againe to the said Ivatt Which he promised to pay
  accordingly And soe all differences betweene the said parties by
  theire owne consent to cease and determine.

  6th February, 1646. It is this day ordered That our M{r} and M{r}
  Warden Browne[207] with the other Assistants Surgeons present doe
  move the Sheriffs That at the time of Execuc͠on a Body be quietly
  delivered to this Companye’s officer for an Anatomy.

  [207] Martin Browne, an eminent Surgeon, Master in 1653, gave the
  Company a Silver loving cup and cover.

  9th March, 1646. This day M{r} Warden Browne acquainted this Court
  that whereas he about 6 yeares sithence had a child of M{r} Hamonds
  to his Patient with whome he upon his first calling thither found
  M{r} Thomas Bowden[208] with others Who after presentac͠on made by
  the Motion of M{r} Warden Browne dyed, that he hath bin reported by
  the ffather of the child to have murthered the child And that M{r}
  Thomas Bowden had justifyed and would justify the same of w{ch}
  scandall M{r} Warden complayneing to this Co{rt} M{r} Bowden prayed
  to be excused from giveing any answer thereunto ffor that there was
  a Suite at Law now depending betweene M{r} Hamond and M{r} Warden
  Browne concerning that matter.

  [208] Warden, 1654.

23rd April, 1646. Mr. Martin Browne requested and had a Committee of
Examiners to enquire into the case of Hamond’s child, and to report to
the Court.

14th May, 1646. The Committee brought up their Report, finding that on
the 28th January, 1639, Mr. Browne was called to Mr. Hamond’s child
in Bow Lane, the child having fallen out of a window and seriously
injured its head. That Mr. Browne consulted with Dr. Spicer and Mr.
Thomas Bowden (whom he found there) and as they all conceived the
child to be in danger, presentation was duly made to the Wardens of
the Barber-Surgeons, that thereupon by general consent, the child was
let blood and had a glister, and the next day his head was shaved
and a cataplasm applied, that these remedies were continued for about
eight days and that then it was deemed advisable to open the head,
which was done by Mr. Browne with a Trapan in the presence and with the
advice and approbation of Mr. Serjeant Clowes (then Master), Mr. George
Dunn[209] (Warden), Mr. William Kings,[210] Mr. Eaton and the said Mr.
Bowden, and that the child died on the 15th day, that proper remedies
had been duly applied and that everything had been done with great care
according to art.

  [217] _i.e._, 1690.

2nd July, 1690. It was ordered that any of the Assistants or Livery
being Surgeons and not appearing at the Public Anatomy were to forfeit
3_s._ 4_d._ each.

  12th December, 1690. Whereas there hath been an abuse offered to M{r}
  ffenton Bynns by Doct{r} Goodall for giveing internall medicines in a
  case of Surgery, Ordered that if the College of Phisitians doe arrest
  M{r} Bynns that he shall bee defended at the cost of the Company for
  the fact now menc͠oned in Court.

  20 July, 1693. Considering some late ill practises in this Company
  relating to Anatomy & to prevent the same for the future it is
  ordered by this Court that noe pˀson what soever (except the Reader,
  Masters & Stewards of Anatomy for the time being) shall use a knife
  &c to disect any humaine body at any time hereafter brought to this
  Hall for an Anatomy upon the forfiture of xl{s} for every fact soe
  com̃itted.

The Court would seem to have had the power of nominating the Surgeons
and Surgeons’ Mates to the ships of the Royal Navy. There are hundreds
of instances in the books of these appointments, but the following will
suffice as examples:--

  11th August, 1693. Ordered that M{r} John Bamber bee warranted
  Chirurgeon of the Waymouth at Portsmouth.

  Ordered that Larkham bee continued on board the Bristoll.

  Ordered that M{r} Harding have the first fowerth rate that shall bee
  ordered out.

  13th February, 1694. Ordered that M{r} Nicholson bee continued
  Chirurgeon of the Oxford & that the Captaine bee acquainted with the
  same.

  27th February, 1694. John Jenkin this day relinquished all title &
  clame to the S{t} Paull ffire shipp, ordered that Richard Woolett bee

  care & see it done.

  20th July, 1698. M{r} Woodward pˀsented five Books of M{r} Arris
  Surgery to the Company.

There is no notice at the British Museum, of any Surgical book written
by Edward Arris; these were probably some books which had belonged to
him.

29th July, 1701. Dr. Tyson having made some proposals as to the
regulation of the Library, a Committee was this day appointed and
drew up a great many rules, which are set out in the minutes with much
prolixity.

3rd December, 1709. It was ordered that no Examiner in Surgery should
in future accept any gratuity from, or be treated or entertained in any
manner by, any Sea Surgeon or Surgeon’s Mate, either before or after
examination, under the penalty of being removed from his offices of
Examiner and Assistant.

1st June, 1710. The Archbishop of Canterbury[218] having licensed
several persons to practise as Surgeons without due examination, the
following memorial was ordered to be sent to his Grace.

[218] Thomas Tenison, ob. 14th December, 1715.

      TO The most Reverend ffather in God Thomas by Divine Providence
          Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.

      THE humble petition of the Masters or Governo{rs} Assistants
          Livery & ffreemen of the Mystery & Comonalty of Barbers &
          Surgeons of London.

    SHEWETH:

  THAT severall Surgeons unlearned & unskilfull in that Art have set up
  & practised within Seven miles of the City of London under Colour of
  a Licence from yo{r} Grace & without the examination & approbation
  of such Surgeons as the Law hath appointed for that purpose ffor
  which reason wee beg leave to lay before yo{r} Grace the following
  representation, viz{t.}:

  THAT the Company of Barbers & Surgeons were incorporated by the
  Charter of King Edward the Second w{ch} was confirmed by the Charter
  of Edward the fourth with this Addic͠onal Clause That the Governo{rs}
  of the Company should examine approve & authorise all such as should
  practise in that ffaculty.[219]

  [219] This statement as to a Charter by Edward II is a fiction, as
  also that it was confirmed by Edward IV, with an additional clause.
  The first Charter was granted by Edward IV, 24th February, 1462. The
  remainder of the facts stated in this letter to the Archbishop are,
  however, correct.

  THAT the said Charter of Edward 4{th} not having provided by
  sufficient penaltys against that great & growing mischeife which
  sprung from the unskillfullness of several vain pretenders in this
  art, It was provided by the Statute of the 3 H. 8, cap. 11 That no
  person within London or seven miles of it should exercise Surgery
  except they were first examined approved & admitted by the Bishop of
  London or Dean of Paul’s calling to him four expert persons in that
  faculty under forfeiture of five pounds pˀ month And out of the City
  & precints seven miles, unless exaĩed & approved by the Bishop of the
  Diocess or his Vicar Generall in like mañer, upon which Statute yo{r}
  petitioners beg leave to observe That it was wholly introductive of a
  new law & creates a power in the Bishop that was before vested in the
  Company by the Charter, so doth it take care to confine that power
  meerly to the Diocesan under the limitation of a regular examination
  in his presence by four persons that had already passed their
  examinations.

  THE Bishop of each Diocess being therefore by their Law invested
  with a Temporall power perfectly forreign to their Ecclesiasticall
  Jurisdiction & Spirituall care We do humbly hope yo{r} Grace will not
  exercise this authority which was never by this law placed in the
  Metropolitane but was only to be exercised by the Diocesan under a
  regular Examination by persons admitted into our Company. And yo{r}
  Grace will find this the more reasonable upon Consideration of this
  Act for the law makes it a part of the Ecclesiasticall concernment
  upon a supposition that severall persons pretending to Surgery had
  practised Sorcery & Witchcraft which yo{r} Grace will pardon us if
  we beg leave to say was an artificiall notion set up by the popish
  Clergy in those times to draw within their own Verge the Inspection &
  approbation of all such persons as attended the beds of dying men.

  BUT however that law was obtained, our Company which consisted of
  all such persons as exercised Surgery within London or seven miles
  being afterwards incorporated by the Statute of 32 H. 8, C. 42, no
  man could practise within London or seven Miles Compass of the City
  without an examination by four of the faculty thus incorporated &
  without being solemnly admitted into the Company.

  AND accordingly the Bishop of London has from time to time been
  pleased to do us that Justice that we humbly presume yo{r} Grace will
  not deny us, viz{t} not to license any person within his Diocess who
  hath not first obtained a Testimoniall under the Seale of our Company
  certifying the examination of such person & his skill & ability for
  the exercise of that art.

  BUT if this restraint of yo{r} Graces Licences were not to be asked
  as a matter of Justice We should not doubt to obtain it as a favour,
  when yo{r} Grace considers how this maner of entring into the faculty
  opens a way to the Ignorant & unskillfull to the great prejudice
  both of the Company & of the publick, for yo{r} Grace cannot be
  so much at leisure from yo{r} pastorall care to enquire into the
  abilitys of such as pretend to sign their Testimonialls nor is any
  person that comes in by this method subject to the regulation of our
  Company’s By-Laws which are all signed under the hands of the two
  Cheife Justices & the present Lord Chancellour & contrived with the
  greatest exactness to regulate the practise of this art, besides that
  every person admitted is obliged to give bond to the Company that he
  will diligently attend such cures as he shall be called unto & that
  he will never wilfully administer any hurtfull medecine, And in all
  cases of danger call in one of our ten Examiners to his assistance
  who are always ready to afford their assistance when asked.

  LASTLY we think we may add that the Companys services of the publick
  may reasonably deserve some consideration from all lovers of the
  publick for that ten of the principall persons of the faculty meet
  once a week at their Hall to examine & approve all Surgeons &
  Surgeons Mates that are in her Majesties Service which amount to five
  hundred in a year & to inspect all Sea Surgeons Chests of medicines &
  instruments & to peruse the Journalls of their practice & to view all
  Sea officers who are wounded in fight & this without the least reward
  nor are any admitted into the Sea Service without their Testimoniall
  & approbation to the very great preservation of the Seamen And tis
  presumed that a Regulation that has been found so necessary at Sea
  will appear at Land to be equally beneficiall.

  WHEREFORE yo{r} petitioners humbly begg that yo{r} Grace will not for
  the future be pleased to give Lycences to any persons to practise
  Surgery within London or seven miles compass thereof untill such
  persons skill & ability for the exercise of that art appears by a
  Testimoniall under our Companys Seale to have been tried & approved
  of by the ten Examiners of our Company appointed for that purpose.

the Examination and certifying of all Army Surgeons (who were then
examined by the Surgeon-General) in the same way that they examined and
passed the Navy Surgeons.

20th February, 1711. Letters similar in effect to the one addressed to
the Archbishop on 1st June, 1710, though slightly differing to meet
some altered circumstances not necessary to be here set forth in
full, were ordered to be sent to the Bishops of London, Winchester and
Rochester, and to the Dean of St. Paul’s.

  6th March, 1711. It is ordered that William Cave one of the Beadles

  Russell in order to make him an evidence upon the s{d} Indictment &
  particularly ag{st} one Samuell Waters whom the Court did likewise
  order to be indicted for the said fact.

It was no uncommon circumstance for candidates under examination to be
rejected, the reason being often rather tersely given, _e.g._:

  13th February, 1712. W{m} Ogilby Rejected & said very Saucily it
  should be the last time.

  Alex{r} Keith Rejected because an Apothecary’s boy.

of the inconvenience arising from his licensing persons to practise

issue any more such licenses without a certificate of fitness from the
Company, it was thereupon ordered that 5 guineas should be paid yearly
to his Lordship’s Registrar as Caveat money.

  28th May, 1713. Ordered that the Clark go to the Secretary at War for

  19th November, 1714. Att this Court John Spurling a Barber at
  Highgate was ordered to be prosecuted upon the Company’s Charter for
  practising Surgery upon John Holmes Barber.

21st April, 1715. The Court being informed that the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty proposed to place the viewing of Sea Surgeons’ chests
with Dr. Oliver and Mr. Rider, Physician and Surgeon of Greenwich
Hospital, to the exclusion of the Company’s rights and contrary to
the Charter of Charles I; it was ordered that a memorial should be
presented to the first Lord against such a proposal.

4th June, 1715. The Lords of the Admiralty having requested the Court
to undertake, with Dr. Oliver, the examination of such Warrant Officers
in the Navy as should apply for superannuation pensions on the ground
of age, wounds or infirmities, the Court directed the Clerk to reply
stating that the Company would perform that office, and hold Courts for

Courts were held and certificates granted from time to time.

  Inspect the Company’s Registers of ffremen and apprentices and The
  Table of Governors Names to enable him to publish his book now in
  hand relateing to the lives and writings of eminent Surgeons.

  [220] At the British Museum there is “A collection of Surgical
  Tracts,” by William Beckett, F.R.S., London, 1740, and in the preface
  thereto it is stated that the collection formed by Mr. Beckett
  relating to eminent Surgeons had not been published.

  5th August, 1720. James King the Surgeon who deposited £7 13_s._
  0_d._ in order to be exaĩed againe as a fforreigne Brother was now
  Examined againe but not being fittly qualifyed he was rejected and
  ordered his money back And ordered to be prosecuted in case he shall
  ever practice Surgery for the future.

23rd June, 1721. The Master represented to the Court that “great
trouble and inconveniency” had arisen in consequence of such Surgeons
as had of late offered themselves for examination not having presented
the Governors and Examiners “with Gloves of such sort and goodness as
had been customarily and antiently given to the Governors and Examiners
upon such examinac͠on and by buying the gloves of tradesemen who were
not proper dealers in such sort of goods.” Whereupon it was ordered
that in future every Candidate before Examination should deposit with
the Clerk as much money as would be sufficient to pay each of the
Governors and Examiners who should be present six shillings, for them
to lay out in the purchase of such gloves as they should see fit. On
the 10th December, 1725, the glove money was raised from 6_s._ to
10_s._ 6_d._

The real secret of the above order, no doubt was, that there were such
a great number of surgeons coming up for examination from time to time,
that the Governors and Examiners got less money and more gloves than
they wanted.

  26th April, 1723. It is ordered that M{r} John Douglass Surgeon
  and a fforeigne brother of this Company shall be admitted into the

  Hen: 8: Cap. 42.

  2nd October, 1724. At this Court Thomas Cooke was examined for a
  fforreigne Brother But being found insufficient he was rejected. Note
  he lives in Duck Lane Publishes Bills as a Quack pretending to the
  cure of the Venereall disease, but he being examined touching the
  cure of that distemper in particular and being found to know little
  or nothing of it, the Court directed him to take down his Surgeon’s
  sign and not to practice for the future on pain of being sued upon
  the Act of Parliament and Company’s Charter.

1725. The following seems somewhat inappropriately placed amongst the
dinner accounts for this year.

  14th October, 1726. At this Court Peter North Boatswain of His
  Majesty’s ship Cornwall was viewed for superannuation and pretended
  to be afflicted with deafness & the Gout. But the Court being of
  opinion that his deafness (if any) was occasion{d} by wax in his ear
  only, which might be cured by syringing, and not being satisfy{d}
  that he had the gout, The Court did not think fit but that he was
  capable of further service at Sea.

  At this Court one Chambers surgeon in Duck Lane was examined touching
  his Skill in Surgery in order to be made a fforeign brother, but
  appearing to be a stupid ffellow & a sort of a Quack who gave out
  Bills, and not being able to answer a question the Court rejected him.

17th February, 1727. The Navy Board having, on the 16th inst., written
to the Master and Wardens enclosing a copy of an anonymous letter
which had been received, charging the Examiners in Surgery with
partiality, and with qualifying incompetent persons as Navy Surgeons,
the Court seem to have taken the matter up in a high spirited manner,
and returned a long letter setting forth their practice in conducting
the Examinations, referring in detail to the particular case alleged
against them, and indeed made a most excellent and satisfactory
defence. The correspondence is very lengthy and full of detail, much
reference being made to the work carried on by the Company for the
public service without fee or reward.

  7th March, 1727. It is ordered That for y{e} future when any
  apprentices are to be bound to Surgeons they shall be called in & be
  examined by themselves touching their skil in y{e} Latin tongue.

  7th April, 1727. James Ripoult a Frenchman was called in but not
  speaking English nor being naturalized the Court did not think it
  proper to examine him.

  5th October, 1727. John Jacob Sax being a Prussian by birth & not
  naturalized nor understanding English The Court did not think it
  proper to examine him.

  William Miles recomended by Lord Torrington & examined but seeming to
  know nothing of Surgery was rejected.

16th January, 1729. A Petition was drawn up by the Court for
presentation to the King, setting forth the Company’s right to four
dead bodies of felons yearly to be obtained at Tyburn, and that of
late divers riotous persons had wrested the bodies from the Company’s
Beadles at the place of execution. The Court declared that these
proceedings were greatly to the detriment of the study of Surgery, and
also set forth the services which the Company rendered to the State, by
examining Surgeons and their Mates for the Royal Navy, viewing their
medicine chests and instruments, viewing all such officers as are
wounded in fight at Sea and for superannuation, and they conclude--

  Your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that your Majesty will
  be graciously pleased to permitt and direct That a ffyle or Two of
  y{r} Majesty’s ffoot Guards shall upon applicac͠on to the Commanding
  Officer attend the publick executions from time to time to guard
  and assist your Petic͠oners Beadles in the taking away so many dead
  bodys yearly as are granted unto your Petic͠oners by the said Act of
  Parliament or otherwise to releive your Petic͠oners in such manner as
  your Majesty in your Majesty’s most gracious wisdom and condescension
  shall think fitt.

The Company seem also to have applied to the Court of Aldermen again
for assistance in this matter, for, on the 7th March following, it was
ordered that 2,000 copies of two orders of the Lord Mayor and Court
of Aldermen, dated respectively 4th February and 4th March, should be
printed, and copies fixed up at Newgate and other public places on the
road to Tyburn, some time before any execution, and also that the said
orders should be inserted in the London Gazette and other papers.

  4th April, 1729. Peregrine Compton Rejected being fuddled & not
  answering a question.

1st February, 1732. It was ordered that any extraordinary cases of
Surgery appearing in the journals of the Sea Surgeons should be copied
out into a book, as well as any others which might be reported to the
Governors, and the same be laid before the Court of Examiners, from
time to time, for their direction as to whether the same should be
published. This book, if it ever existed, is not now in the Company’s
possession.

  15th August, 1734. It is ordered that from henceforward a Silver
  Medal not exceeding the value of a Guinea with a proper device upon
  each side of it to be made and presented at the end of the year to
  each of the Demonstrators now chosen and to the Demonstrators for the
  time being as an acknowledgment for their trouble in performing such
  Demonstrations.

These medals by a subsequent order, were to have a representation of
Holbein’s picture on one side and of Inigo Jones’ Theatre on the other,
but they do not appear to have ever been struck.

It was customary at the Demonstrations of Anatomy to provide specimens
of parts of animals, presumably for comparison, as appears by some of
the expenses incurred, _e.g._, in 1732:--

  To a sheeps hart & kidney                            0  0  6
  A sheeps hart and lights                             0  0  4
  2 Bullocks eyes                                      0  0  4

and the following is the Beadle’s Bill at the dissection of a female
malefactor in 1735:--

  For a board to lay her head upon                     0  0  4
  For a board to shew her liver upon                   0  1  0
  For two bullocks eyes                                0  0  4
  For four sheeps eyes                                 0  0  4
  For a quarter of soap                                0  0  1-1/2
  For hogs brissels                                    0  0  1

                                                      ------------
                                                      £1  7  8-1/2
                                                      ============

4th February, 1735. Under this date is an entry of a long letter from
the Commissioners of the Navy, complaining of the want of skill in a
Surgeon, whereby great mortality had ensued on the ship _Newcastle_;
the Court examined the Surgeon and his Journal and considered that
there was nothing to find fault with as regarded his proficiency in
Surgery, and that the sickness among the ship’s crew required skill
in Physic rather than in Surgery, moreover they declared that the
Physician at Greenwich examined the Navy Surgeons as to their skill
in Physic and not the Barber-Surgeons’ Company. The Clerk was directed
to write to the Commissioners to this effect, and to state that the
Company did not consider themselves answerable for any man’s want of
skill in Physic.

A long letter dated 5th February was accordingly written and is set out
in the Minute Book. The Surgeon complained of was Thomas Middleton, son
of Mr. Henry Middleton (the oldest Member of the Court) and it appears
that he had been fully examined and qualified.

29th September, 1735. The following order touching the vexed question
of dead bodies was issued by the Sheriffs:--

  ~London~ TO WITT

  IN PURSUANCE of an Act of Parliament made in the Thirty second year
  of King Henry the Eighth and of an order of Sessions bearing date
  the eighth day of July in the Fifteenth year of our late Sovereign
  Lord King Charles the First Sir Maurice Abbott Mayor. ~Wee~ do
  order and command our Officers who are entrusted with or attend
  the execution of such Malefactors as shall be to dye at any time
  hereafter during our Sheriffalty to deliver to Henry Gretton and
  William Littlebury Beadles of the Company of Barbers and Surgeons
  of London or such other Officer or Officers as the Company shall
  appoint, One of the Bodys of the said Malefactors from time to time
  for a publick Dissection and to assist them with the said body to
  their Hall according to an Order of the Court of Aldermen of the
  Thirteenth of February 1675[221] Sir William Hooker Mayor and to two
  other subsequent Orders of the Court of Aldermen one bearing date the
  fourth day of February the other the fourth day of March 1728[222]
  Sir Robert Baylis Knight Lord Mayor.

  [221] 1676 N.S.
  [222] 1729 N.S.

  Given under our hands this 29{th} day of September 1735.

                                                  JN{O} BARNARD
                                                  RO{T} GODSCHALL.

  1st June, 1736. It is ordered that the Constables of the Holborn
  Division shall be allowed Three Guineas and a halfe above the Guinea
  already paid them in regard to their expences at the last execution,
  when the Body was taken from the Beadles and retaken by the
  Constables and the Clerk is ordered to repay the same But the Clerk
  is not to pay the officers of the Compter the Two guineas usually
  received by them at every execution.

  24th September, 1741. John Thrift the Executioner this day attended
  on a complaint made against him by the Beadles for obstructing the
  Bodys being brought from Tyburne to the Hall for dissection and
  threatning to prevent the Company’s measures for obtaining the same,
  when after he had been reproved, was Dismissed, But the Court then
  agreed (in order to prevent his intended proceedings) to attend the
  Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen that they may on complaint made be
  releived therein.

  18th December, 1741. Ordered that the High Constable of Holburne be
  allowed Ten shillings and sixpence as his ffee for every Body that
  shall be brought from Tyburne and delivered at this Company’s Hall
  and for his aiding and assisting the Company’s Beadles therein and
  not otherwise.

10th February, 1742. The Court either forgetting or ignoring their
order of 7th May, 1713, now ordered that Mr. William Skelton, a proctor
in Doctors’ Commons, who had for many years past received five guineas
annually as Caveat money (being Registrar of the Bishop of London)
and “pretended to be allowed him by this Company on account of his
Lordship’s Grant for the Prohibiting of Surgeons to practice within
his Diocese be no longer entitled to such fee untill such time as this
Court shall be better informed of the nature of his right of demanding
the same.”

23rd November, 1740. Great consternation prevailed at the Hall in
consequence of a malefactor who had been hung at Tyburn having revived
when brought here for dissection. The account of this remarkable
occurrence is recorded by the Clerk, Mr. Joseph Wheeler, on the last
page of the rough Minute Book 1738-1742, and is very interesting.
From the record of his trial at the Old Bailey (see Sessions Papers)
Duell appears to have been an outrageous young scoundrel. A popular
impression prevails, and frequent currency has been given to it, that
Duell subsequently made a fortune abroad and out of gratitude to the
Barber-Surgeons for saving his life, presented them with the handsome
leather folding screen now in the Court Room, the best answer to
which is, that the screen in question is referred to in the Company’s
Inventory some thirty years previously to Mr. Duell’s visit to Tyburn.

Mr. Wheeler’s account is as follows--

    November the 23{d.} 1740.

  This day W{m.} Duell (who had been indicted at the Old Bayley for a
  Rape and had received sentence of Death for the same) was carryed
  to Tyburne in order to be executed where having hung some time was
  cutt down and brought to this Company’s Hall in order to be dissected
  where he had not been five minutes before Life appeared in him &
  being let blood and other means used for his recovery in less than
  two hours he sat upright drank some warm wine and lookˀd often round
  him and before he was carryed back to Newgate which was about Twelve
  o’the Clock at Night he severall times pronounced distinctly the
  word DONT when anybody touched him though was thought to be mostly
  insensible of anything but paine which in a great measure he endured
  by his most violent screamings & was often in strong convulsions in
  his bowells which he then exprest by applying his hands to those
  parts.

  The Sheriffs having ordered him back to Newgate he was carryed out in
  a blankett putt into a Coach & was seemingly much composed & quiet
  not making any manner of noise wherein 3 or 4 days time he recovered
  sufficient to converse & eat & drink very freely but never could give
  any reasonable account of what had passed. He afterwards obtained a
  reprieve in order to be transported for life which he was accordingly
  in the 16th year of his age. (_Vide_ his Tryall in the Sessions paper
  of that time.)

The Wardens’ accounts give the following particulars relative to this
case:--

                                                      £  _s._ _d._

SURGICAL LECTURES AND DEMONSTRATIONS.


There are many references throughout the books to the Lectures and
Demonstrations of Anatomy at our Hall, as well as indications that
from the period of Incorporation (1462), if not earlier, the Company
took care to provide for the professional education of its members and
apprentices, and to increase their proficiency in Surgical science.

[Footnote: The initial letter ~T~ is reduced from one in the Audit
Book, 1612-13.]

In addition to the Examiners in Surgery (who though not necessarily
members of the Court of Assistants were often consulted by the Masters
or Governors) there were chosen “Masters and Stewards of the Anatomy,”
generally two Masters and two Stewards, on whom devolved the duty of
conducting the Demonstrations, and arranging for the Dinners which
invariably followed. The exact duties of these officials are not at all
times clearly defined, though elsewhere will be found allusions to, and
orders concerning their offices and functions, but it may be generally
taken that the Stewards dissected and prepared the body, the Masters
reading the Lectures thereon to the assembled Surgeons and their
apprentices.

These Demonstrations usually took place four times in the year, and
were termed “Public Anatomies,” from the fact that the subject was
generally a public body, _i.e._, a malefactor, and the attendance of
the free Surgeons was compulsory on these occasions; besides these
Public Anatomies, there were also an indefinite number of “Private
Anatomies” held at the Hall, and at these the attendance was by
invitation. It was illegal for any one to dissect a “humane bodye”
within the limits of the Company’s jurisdiction without the permission
of the Masters or Governors, and whenever a Surgeon was desirous
to anatomatize some specially interesting subject, it was termed a
“Private Anatomy,” and generally performed at the Hall by permission,
the Surgeon inviting his own friends and pupils, and the Court inviting
whom they chose. (See the curious entry as to a Private Anatomy, page
321.)

Besides the Demonstrations of Anatomy, public and private, there were
several other lectures delivered (oftentimes once a week) by members
of the College of Physicians and members of the Company; two of these,
which were trusts, the Arrisian Lecture and Gale’s Anatomy still
survive I believe, at the Royal College of Surgeons; the others were
provided by the Company out of their corporate funds.

Among some loose papers at the Hall, I found a MS. relating to the
lectures, which I lent to Mr. D’Arcy Power, who incorporated it in
his work, as “Appendix M.” I have since compared this document with the
original minutes, and finding it somewhat incorrect and imperfect, have
prepared the following more accurate account.

Previous to 1566 Dr. William Cunningham was Reader at the Hall. He was
author of the “Cosmographical Glasse containing the pleasant principles
of Cosmographie Geographie Hydrographie or Navigation,” London, 1599.
fo. Dr. Cunningham resided at Norwich 1556-9, whence he removed to
London. He wrote a letter prefacing John Hall’s book against the
“beastlye abusers” of Surgery, which is dated at Coleman Street, 18th
April, 1565, and he also wrote a recommendatory letter in Thomas Gale’s
“Certeine workes of Chirurgerie,” London, 1586. 4{to.}

  Alsoe it is further ordered that dureing the tyme of reading of

  in Surgerye by an approved surgion of this Companie, this Court did
  againe deliberate upon the same and every one of the Assistants

  lectures read by the approved Surgians of this house according to our

Among a collection of old books on Surgery, in my possession, is a
small quarto by Dr. Read (dedicated to Thomas, Lord Windsor, who was
free of the Barber-Surgeons) and entitled:--

  The Chirurgicall Lectures of Tumors and Ulcers delivered on Tuesdayes
  appointed for these exercises, and keeping of their Courts in the
  Chirurgeans Hall these three yeeres last past, viz. 1632, 1633 and

  Corporac͠on for ever the sum of 250{li} to the end and upon Condic͠on
  that a humane Body be once in every yeare hereafter publiquely
  dissected and six Lectures thereupon read in this Hall if it may be
  had with Conveniency and the Charges to be borne by this Company
  And if noe humane Body may be had nor conveniently dissected in one
  yeare then the Company to destribute One halfe of the Sum of the

  drawne by our Clerke against the next Court of Assistants for the
  performance thereof And to that purpose a Rent charge of xx{li} pˀ
  annum be granted out of our Lands at Holborne Bridge.

  [225] It was the worthy Alderman Arris himself.

  24th November, 1645. This Court taking into Considerac͠on in what
  manner the publique Bodyes hereafter shalbe dissected and by whome
  that Anatomy which is now newly about to be established shalbe
  performed Doth thinke fitt and soe Order That the present M{rs} of
  Anatomy or such others as shalbe appointed by the two M{rs} Surgeons

  the same and that the manner of dissections of every publique Anatomy
  shalbe such as they the said Two M{rs} or Governo{rs} for the time
  being and Examiners on the more part of them shall direct.

30th January, 1646. The draft deed of settlement for the Arrisian
Lectures was brought into Court and (6th February, 1646) approved; but
it appearing at the next Court that there was some technical difficulty
as to the names of the feoffees it was remitted to the donor’s counsel.

  20th February, 1646. This Court doth agree That the Deed of an
  Annuity formerly granted to the use of the new publique Anatomy be
  made for 24{li} upon the Considerac͠on of 300{li} And it is promised
  by M{r} Arris on the behalfe of the Donor That if the 300{li} shalbe
  restored within 12 yeares he or his Heires shall grant unto this
  Company for the same use the like sum of 24{li} p. Annum out of some
  of his Lands or Tenements And doe nominate and appoint for ffeeoffees
  M{r} Dunn M{r} Collins M{r} Kings M{r} Pinder M{r} ffleete M{r} Arris

  of 24{li} pˀ annũ for the use of the new publique Anatomy Whereupon
  the Deed of Grant of the said Annuity and for establishing the said
  new Anatomy was sealed with the Com̃on Seale and Delivered to the
  Donor and the severall ffeoffees intrusted in that matter.

In consequence of our later Minutes being lost, it is not possible to
say precisely how this trust came to be varied and increased, though
from the House of Commons Journals (see p. 160) it can be conjectured
almost to a certainty to have been as follows:--Within twelve years
from the date of the original grant (say in 1658) the Company returned
the £300 to Alderman Arris, and he thereupon settled upon them a rent
charge, not of £24 as he had promised to do, but of £30 per annum
payable out of some of his houses. He seems however, subsequently,
to have had good reason to believe that his only son and heir, Dr.
Thomas Arris, M.P., would give the Company trouble in the matter of the
settlement, and so, on the 29th February, 1676, he requested that his
deed of grant might be given up to him cancelled, and that he should
in return give the Company £510 absolutely and free from any trust,
save only an honorable understanding that the Anatomy Lectures should
be continued. This was done, and after his death (which happened 28th
May, 1676) the Company were involved in a Chancery suit with Dr. Thomas
Arris who endeavoured, though unsuccessfully, to recover possession of
the £510.

  17th July, 1646. Whereas 300{li} hath bin worthily given to this
  House for the Discharge of all expences to be layd out in and about
  a publique Anathomy to be henceforth had yearely for ever Betweene
  the ffeaste of Michaelmas and Christmas in every yeare And for
  that Doctor Prudjon who formerly read the Anatomicall Lectures
  hath desired to be excused from reading the Lectures on the next
  Anathomyes to be dissected betweene Michaelmas and Christmas next
  This Court doth think fitt That Doctor Wright be desired to performe
  the same And that the M{rs} of the Anatomy for the time being When
  the said Anatomy shalbe dissected do alwayes in theire severall &
  respective times of M{rs} of Anatomy dissect the said Anatomy And
  this Court doth thinke fitt That the dissection of the said Anatomy
  be of the Muscles of the Body But that the manner thereof be left to
  the Judgement of the Reader and the Dissectors.

  21st September, 1646. Our M{r} acquainting the Court that Doctor
  Prudjon and divers other learned Physitions have recõmended Doctor
  [John] Goddard as a Man well qualifyed and very able to reade the
  Anatomicall Lectures This Court doth Order That Doctor Prudjon be
  requested to performe the Lectures On the next publique Anatomy
  himselfe But if he shall Deny it That then Doctor Goddard Or such
  other as Doctor Prudjon shall thinke more fitt be desired to read the
  Lectures.

  23rd October, 1646. This Court doth Order That all the approved
  Chirurgeons according to Law shall appeare at all publique Anatomyes
  for the time to come in a fflatt Capp upon the penalty of 3{s} 4{d}
  and all the rest of the Livery in a Hatt.

  24th December, 1646. This Court doth thinke fitt and soe Order That
  the M{rs} or Governours and Assistants nor any of them Nor any of
  the M{rs} or Stewards of Anathomy doe invite or enterteyne any
  Guest at any of the Three Dinners to be had within this Hall at the
  next publique Anatomy Or at any other publique Anathomy betweene
  Michaelmas and Christmas in any yeare hereafter But doth consent &
  Order That Doctor Prudjon be invited to the said Dinners Anything
  aforesaid to the contrary Notwithstanding.

  7th January, 1647. Whereas this Court is well satisfyed That Doctor
  Prudjon is desireous to be excused from reading the next Anatomicall
  Lectures This Court doth Order That Doctor Goddard be desired to
  performe the same.

  15th February, 1647. This Court doth thinke fitt and soe Order That
  the Tuesday Lectures be againe revived and read by Chirurgeons
  ffreemen of this Company in their turnes according to theire
  authority[226] in the Livery. The eldest Assistant Chirurgeon to read
  the first Lecture and that to be On the first Tuesday in May next and
  the other to be from thence monethly and noe oftner viz{t} The ffirst
  Tuesday in evˀy moneth Provided Nevertheles That when as any such
  Tuesday shall not be within the time lymitted in and by an Order of
  a Court of Assistants of ix{th} August 1632 in that behalfe Or shall
  happen to be on any the dayes thereby excepted That then every such
  Tuesday be noe Lecture day.

  [226] A clerical mistake for “antiquity,” _i.e._, precedence.

The order of the 9th August, 1632, above referred to, was as follows--

  ALSOE this daye this Court for removeing of uncerteinties & setling
  of one certeyne course and forme for Courts to be kept on y{r}
  Tuesdayes in every yeare doe now upon deliberac͠on had, order that
  from henceforth for ever hereafter there shalbe Lectures reade &
  Courts held in the Comon Hall of this Companie at such dayes and
  times in every yeare annually as hereafter followeth viz{t} on
  every Tuesdaye w{ch} shalbe betwixt Michaelmas daye and the Tenth
  daye of December, On every Tuesdaye betwixt the ffeast of Epiphanie
  and Palme Sondaye, on every Tuesdaye betwixt Easter holydayes and
  Rogac͠on weeke, on every Tuesdaye betwixt Whitesonday holydayes and
  the last daye of Julye. Provided alwayes that if it shall happen any
  of the aforesaid Tuesdayes to fall out to be either on a holydaye or

WARDENS’ AND OTHER ACCOUNTS.


The Great Book of Wardens’ Accounts has unfortunately been kept in a
damp place, and the earlier portion of it is severely damaged. The
cover still indicates the elaboration of the bookbinder’s art, being
stamped in patterns with the portcullis fleur de lys and Tudor rose;
opposite what is left of the first page is a magnificently painted
achievement of the Company’s arms on vellum, but this unhappily, is
damaged.

The first page has rotted almost entirely away, leaving only the upper
left hand corner, on which there is an initial letter T illuminated in
the highest style of art, though this is also seriously damaged.

The accounts commence with those for the year 1603, the first few pages
are worn away, pages 7 to 36 are but slightly damaged, whilst the
remainder of this huge book is quite perfect and abounds with quaint
and artistic initial letters.

The following is the reduced initial letter for the year 1610-11.

[Illustration]

1603. The Wardens account for quarterage received by them amounting to
£4 17_s._ 6_d._, this quarterage was 2_s._ for each freeman, though
some did not pay, and others had only paid 6_d._ or 1_s._

£5 was received for the admission of six foreign brethren.

Twenty-five freemen were admitted, who paid 3_s._ 4_d._ each on
presentation.

Eighty-nine apprentices were bound, each paying 2_s._ 6_d._

Then follows a list of arrearages of debts due from freemen and others

Falling bands (which are described in Planche’s Cyclopedia of Costume)
were considered by the Court an “excess of apparel,” then rigorously
suppressed. Thomas Allen, here referred to, was Warden 1620-1-2, and

The Recorder had a yearly “fee” of £6 in this and many subsequent
years, most probably to secure his friendship towards the Company.

[Footnote: The initial letter ~T~ is reduced from one in the Audit
Book, 1623-4.]

In 1623 occurs the last entry of the Company keeping “Gowries day.”

  1625-6. Received of John Pinder for his

Every year about this period is an entry for wooden Trenchers,
generally a gross of them, and the cost about 6_s._

There are also many entries for “boat hire”; whenever a journey was
taken it seems to have nearly always been on the river, and only on
rare occasions is horse hire mentioned.

  1626-7. Given by order of Court amongst miserable
    poore people                                          xl{s}

  Given by consent to a poore souldier that
    shewed a Mandrake to this Courte                       v{s}

The root of the mandrake is said to bear a resemblance to the
human form, and the “poore souldier” was not disappointed when he
thought that by laying such a professional curiosity before the
Barber-Surgeons, he would receive a benevolence.

  Paid unto the Chamᵬlaine of London for the
    Kings use as by precept                    ccclx{li}
  Paid and disbursed for takeing downe and
    carryeing of King Henrye the 8 picture
    to White hall for the Kinge to see and
    bringeing it back and setting it up againe           xij{s}

James I in 1617 borrowed this picture, his letter demanding it is
still at Barbers’ Hall, and it would appear by this entry that his son
Charles did the same; the wonder is that we have still got it, after
running two such risks.

  1628-9. Paid M{r} Greene the Gouldsmith for
    the silver and makeing of 4 new Garlandꝭ
    as pˀ bill                                    xx{li}

drawer, 3 butchers, 1 merchant, 1 sempster, 1 grocer, 1 thridman, 1

    his funerall daie by order of Court                    x{s}

other not very cheerful compositions.

the office of warden of the Yeomanry paying £7 and all others £10.

other entries to a like effect.

The Company paid £16 “ship-money” this year.

  Paid to the Clocke Smith for mendinge the Clock         iij{s}

This entry is curious, being the transition name of a trade; the
blacksmiths were originally the clockmakers (_see_ p. 399); here we
have the “clock smith” and later on the “clock maker.”

The records obtained from the Guildhall and the Tower to which
reference is made in the following extracts, and which are preserved
in a vellum book (still in the possession of the Company) were made by
William Colet, here called “Colley.” The record from the Tower has been

1636-7. In the previous year £480 had been paid in respect of the
building of the Anatomical Theatre and this year a further sum of
£242 17_s._ 4_d._ This was exclusive of the cost of digging for the
foundations which the Company did by their own labourers, whom they
paid 16_d._ per day each. It was the practice of the Company to allow
each workman engaged, whether labourers or mechanics, 1_d._ a day for

    for S{r} Thomas ffairfax his Armie                       CCCCv{li}

The Company were bound under precepts directed to them, to press
Surgeons for the Army and to provide them each with a Medicine chest
and Instruments value £15. It is a remarkable circumstance that the
Parliament should have _paid_ the money to the Company for this
service, a proceeding contrary to the practice then in vogue.

At this time it appears that the indebtedness of the Company to various
creditors for monies lent to enable them to meet the demands of the
authorities amounted to no less a sum than £2,633 4_s._ This was
borrowed at 6, 7 and 8 per cent. interest upon the seal of the house;
the Company had pawned the best of their ancient plate to satisfy the
rapacity of the King and the army, and the following pitiful entry
speaks volumes--

  Paid for the hyre of 4 Cupps for the elecc͠on                  0  2  0

    house towards his inlargement out of prison                  2  0  0

Mr. Greenbury had often been employed by the Company as a portrait
painter, and it is delightful to notice their kindly regard for him in
both his and their evil days.

1648-9. In 1644 the Company had pawned their plate, but seem to have
redeemed it within the next year or two, for under this year we read
that plate to the value of £297 11_s._ 8_d._ was _absolutely_ sold to
Mr. Thomas Madox, Goldsmith, and other plate was pledged with Mr. John
Browne for £250.

who seems to have espoused the cause of the Barber-Surgeons.

The Company made very many grants of money to the poor stricken people
about this time; and further contributed £69 9_s._ 6_d._ towards the
Ship “The Loyal London.”

[268] Pepys also kept this day. He says,--“Thankes-giving day for
victory over the Dutch. To the Dolphin Taverne, where all we officers
of the Navy met with the Commissioners of the Ordnance by agreement,
and dined: where good musique at my direction. Our club came to 34_s._

alone, observing the several humours of the citizens that were there
this holiday, pulling off cherries, and God knows what.”

These contributions were voluntary and are accounted for every year for
a considerable period. At the end of the book is a long and detailed
list of the contributors, commencing 23rd April, 1668, and extending
to March, 1681. There seem to have been 398 subscribers, and the sum
collected from them was £1,850; this amount, however, was wholly
inadequate for the rebuilding of the hall, which appears by entries
extending over 1668 to 1674, to have cost the Company no less than
£4,292. The deficit was made up by sales of freehold property in the
City, for what to us, in these days, would seem absurdly low prices,
and by loans, etc.

1668-9. The Company received from the Chamber of London £620 6_s._
6_d._, being the return of £500 lent to the King in November, 1664,
and the interest thereon £120 6_s._ 6_d._ This is the _only_ instance
recorded of any forced loan having been refunded.

rowers, besides the Barge Master, and these men had 4_s._ each for
rowing on Lord Mayor’s day.

1669-70. Serjeant Surgeon John Knight wainscotted the Parlour at his
own charge, and Mr. Barker glazed the Windows; part of this glazing is
still preserved. It should be borne in mind that the present Court room
or Parlour (as it was formerly called) and which was the work of Inigo
Jones in 1636 was not destroyed in the Great Fire.

1670-1. The freehold property in Conyhope Lane, Grocers’ Hall Court,
was sold to the Corporation of London for £190.

1671-2. The livery this year numbered one hundred and eighty-five
persons.

1672-3. The Company sold an extensive property at Holborn Bridge to the

The whole of the Wardens’ accounts from 1674 to 1715 are unfortunately
lost, and the next book embraces the years between 1715 and 1785.

1715-16. The Ironmongers’ Company rented at £5 per annum from the
Barber-Surgeons a portion of their Barge House at Lambeth for the
Ironmongers’ Barge. Our Company still retained their Barge and
Bargemaster and this year purchased for him a new livery.

date.

The Livery dinners on these occasions were paid for by the Stewards.

The next book of Accounts extends from 1785 to 1821, but like the
latter part of the last one it is almost destitute of interest. On the
first page is an extract from the Will of Mr. Edward Griffin (10th
April, 1596) relating to his gift to the Company, and there are also
sundry memoranda concerning Banckes’ gift.

1785. This was the last occasion on which the Company “went out” on
Lord Mayor’s day.

In addition to the Wardens’ accounts, there are two books containing
receipts of tradesmen and others for money paid to them extending from
1722 to 1764. These books are not specially interesting, excepting that
they contain autographs of a few eminent Surgeons, hangmen and others,
and the following extracts will suffice:--

  1722. Recẽd of the Governours of the Company the sume of ten
  shillings for fetching the Body of Richard Oxer from Tyburne.

                                                       CHARLES WINDOW.

  1723. Recẽd of the Governours of the Compã the sume of five pounds
  fifteen shillings for fetching the Body of W{m} Pincher from Tyburne
  and for sev{ll} Disbursements expended thereon.

                                                       RICH: COLLINS.

1723. The Receipt of Abraham Shepherd, Attorney, for £15 0_s._ 6_d._,
being the costs of prosecuting Cooke and others for taking away the
body of William Pincher from the Beadles when they brought it from
Tyburn.

  1729. Rec̃ed Dec{r} 23{d} 1729 of the Gov{rs} of y{e} Comp{a} pˀ the
  hands of Cha: Bernard their Cl: 7{s} 6{d} for my Xmãs Box.

                                                       JOHN HOOPER.

In 1730 this gentleman signs “John Hooper, Executioner.”

1743. The hangman, John Thrift, signed with a × the receipt
for his Christmas box, and the Clerk has humorously styled him “John
Thrift, Esq{re} Hangman.”

1736. The printing of 1,000 Copies of Baron’s Engraving of Holbein’s
picture cost £15 15_s._ 0_d._ John Harper was the printer.

A copy of this print was sent to the Earl of Burlington, as there is a
Bill of William Gills as follows:--

  One large picture frame w{th} a broad carved & Gilt
    Sanding inside and a fine plate glass &c for The
    Earl of Burlington                                          £2  8  0

DISPUTES.


1388. One of our earliest ordinances enacts that--

  If any dispute arise between any of the brethren, which God forbid,
  it is to be amicably settled by the decision of the Masters of the
  said Fraternity and they are to deal plainly,[273] and that no one
  sue another in other manner than at the assize, and then only if he
  be empowered by leave of the said Masters to be recorded.

  [273] _i.e._, openly, honestly.

1530. And again in the ordinances signed by Sir Thomas More, it states
that--

  yff any matter of stryffe or debate herafter be betwene eny pˀson
  of the said Crafte as God fforfende that noon of them shall make
  eny pˀsuts[274] in the Comen lawe but that he whiche ffyndeth hym
  aggreved shall ffurst make his complaynt to the Maisters . . . . . .
  to thˀentent that they shall ordre the said matter or cause of
  complaynt so made yff they can . . . . . .

  [274] Pursuits.

This prerogative of the Company was jealously guarded, and indeed
extended, the Court becoming in effect a sort of Court of Conscience,
in which _non-freemen_ frequently appeared as plaintiffs against
freemen, when their cases were heard and adjudicated upon, the Court
settling the amount and time of payment, or dismissing the suit.

Whenever (as often happened) one freeman went to law with another,
without leave of the Court, and the defendant complained, the
plaintiff was ordered to withdraw his action, and if he declined to do
so, an opportunity of reflection upon the powers of the Company was
afforded him in the seclusion of the “Compter.”

It was frequently the custom for the Masters to require both parties to
enter into bonds to abide the decision of the Court, and where this was
not so, and either of them disobeyed the order made, the offender was
either fined, imprisoned or expelled.

The following are a few notices of cases of dispute which came before
the Court from time to time, and other instances will be found
elsewhere.

30th June, 1551. It was ordered--

  That James Wood John Chamber and William Drewe Waterman shalbe lovers
  and friendes and clerlye to acquite and discharge either other of and
  from all maner of acc͠ons quarrells detts demaundes and suts as well
  spirytuall as temporall whatsoever they be from the begynnyng of the
  worlde untyll the daye abovesayd.

4th November, 1551. Ordered--

  That John West shall bring in his fyne which is vj{s} viij{d} for
  speking opprobryous wordes against John Androwson in the presence of
  the M{r.}

2nd May, 1552. It was ordered and declared that Harry Cooke and
Nicholas Connysbye--

  are fully condescended concluded and agreed for all maner of acc͠ons
  dettes suetts demaunds and quarrells whatsoever they be from the
  begynnynge of the worlde unto this daye and that they shall clerly
  dischardge eche other and to be lovers and freinds.

1566. By an entry in this year it seems that each disputant when before
the Court was “put to his othe upon a booke y{t} he sholde saye the
trothe.”

10th December, 1566. Thomas Lambkyn appeared against his late
apprentice W{m} Woodfall--

  for serten shavynge clothes y{t} he tooke awaye w{th} hym when he
  went frome his M{r} w{th}out his lycence and the saide W{m} hath
  payde unto the saide Thom̃s Lambkyn in the pˀsents of this courte in
  lawfull Englyshe mony x{s} in recompence.

  In this Courte here was John Hawkes playntyf agaynst Richard Olkar
  for his unfyttinge words & Olkar shalbe here the nexte courte.

30th December, 1566. William Collins the covenant servant of John
Johnson complained of his master for “myssusing hym in his boxe money,”
whereupon M{r} Johnson was ordered to amend his ways.

  4th March, 1567. Here was Walter Lynche for his unfytting wordꝭ
  seyeng y{t} Richard Dycson sholde be got his mayde w{th} chylde and
  Lynche denyeth yt, y{t} he nevˀ harde of yt, and Dycson sey{d} y{t}

  y{t} they shall brotherly one gyve unto & by another good wordꝭ &
  good reports & no more repetallꝭ to be had any more hereafter in this
  behalf.

  11th March, 1567. In this Court here was John Wall for y{t} he warned
  John Staple unto the courte of concyence in the guyldehall in London
  w{th}oute lycence of the M{r} & Govˀno{rs} and yt is now ordered
  once agayne y{t} John Wall shall not pˀcede any forder in lawe but
  shall stande to the awarde made ordered & awarded the xij{th} daye
  of november laste paste and not ells otherwyse upon payne of his
  alegiance & penaltie in that behalf pˀvyded & ordayned.

Edward Park, who was a troublesome fellow, and often before the Court,
would seem (by the next extract) to have revived the old scandal about
Dycson and his “mayde,” for--

  14th November, 1567. Here was Rich. Dycson playntyf agaynst Edward
  Parke for undecent and slaunderous words And they both have consented
  to put yt unto the determynacion of this worsshypfull Court, & they

  he hath chosen for hym M{r} Bowie & Rich Wysto & the M{r} & govnors
  shalbe umpers,[276] bonde in xx{li} a peece.

  [275] Award.
  [276] Umpires.

  13th January, 1568. In thys Courte here was John Cooke playntyf
  against Rich{d} Barker for serten wordꝭ undecently spoken by Rich{d}
  against the said John and also for serten housold stuff y{t} the said
  Rich{d} Barker w{th}holdeth frome the said John, and they both are
  comaunded the nexte courte daye to brynge in bothe y{r} fynes vj{s}
  viij{d} a pece for y{r} unfytting wordꝭ.

  that Rich. Barker beate black her armes and yt is ordered that the
  said Rich. Barker shall upon this pˀsent daye go unto the house of
  the said John Burges his m{r} and y{r} acknowledge hym sylf to be
  sory for trespassynge hym & his wyf.

  pntꝭ[277] & kepeth shoppe & is accomptant wekely to his M{r} & he
  said the M{r} of the company did hym wronge & y{t} he wolde at
  lawe trye yt and unreverently he did behave hymsylf w{th} stoute
  & undecent [words] & so he charged the M{r} styll, but not the
  worsshypfulls of this Courte.

  [277] Apprentice.

  18th November, 1572. Here was one Edward Browne Bricklayer and
  complayned [against] one Richard Upton for that he had taken his
  money for curynge hym of Morbus Gallicus but the sicknes as he said
  was not cured & M{r} Upton pˀmised to agree w{th} hym.

The next is a rare piece of tittle tattle; like Edward Park, Colley
was often in trouble, and it is amusing to observe how he shortly
afterwards lays an information against Carrington, which compliment
Carrington returns to him in the March Court.

  18th November, 1572. Here was Willm̃ Carington and required his
  complaint to be herd in that Allein Colley had slaundered hym w{th}
  unhonest wordes, that is, that Allein should say that Wiberds wife
  should say that Charringtons wief should not be honest, and they were
  pˀmytted to take ordre of Lawe.

10th February, 1573. Colley laid an information against Carrington for
“Trimminge on a Sondaye,” whereupon he was fined 40_s._

11th March, 1573. Carrington complained of Colley “for undecent wordes
calling him verlet before the Mr.,” etc., and they were ordered to be
friends, and to bring no more complaints against each other.

This feud seems, however, to have continued for a few years, but was at
last happily settled, for we read under date, 24th January, 1576:

  Here at this Co{r}te witnesses being hard betwene Willm̃ Carrington
  and Allen Collye they were made frendes, shoke handes and frendly
  depˀted.

  2nd March, 1573. Here was a complaint agaynste Henrye Lushe by John
  Parradize for that the said Henry Lushe called the said John Paradize
  knave, and he p{d} his fyne xij{d} and they toke hands & were ffrends.

  19th April, 1574. Here was Willm̃ Brode and brought in an answere
  agaynste the complaynt of Edward Saunders for lykeninge hym to
  Esoppes dogge and they were appoynted to be ffrends and to brynge the
  matter no more in question.

Was this the “dog in the manger”? Anyhow, it seems a trivial matter to
have been brought before the grave old Masters.

  2nd February, 1575. Here came one Willm̃ Goodnep and complayned of
  Willm̃ Clowes for not curing his wief de morbo gallico and yt was

It was not often that the good offices of the Court were unavailing in

unable to settle the matter:--

There are numerous excellent examples of the Company’s Arms at the
Hall. The records contain many beautiful drawings and emblazoned
shields of arms, not only of the Company but of some of the Masters as
well.

One of the choicest specimens is the massive old carving beneath the
semicircular canopy of the entrance doorway; this is dated 1671, and
is both bold and quaint; long may it be preserved to the Barbers!
The carved coat of arms which formerly ornamented the stern of the
Company’s barge, and which is probably late 17th century work, has
been carefully preserved, and may be always admired over the chimney
piece in the Committee room. There is the large “tortershell” in the
vestibule given by Mr. William Kings in 1645. The cloth on the Court
table is artistically embroidered with the Arms of the Company and
the City, the embroidered portions being part of the ancient barge
cloth. There is a handsomely emblazoned coat of arms on the plan of
the Company’s property (presented by Mr. Charles John Shoppee), and
a pretty little bit of old stained glass in the window on the first
floor landing. The Company formerly possessed a great many banners, but
these are unfortunately lost to us; the one which is placed behind the
Master’s chair is beautifully painted by Bishop of Doctors’ Commons,
and has at the back the inscription--

    EX DONO SIDNEY YOUNG MISTERII BARBITONSORUM FRATRIS AMANDI 1885.

1451. In this year the original grant of arms was conferred, being
simply the first quarter of our present achievement; sable, a chevron
between three fleams argent, the fleams being mediæval lancets, though
from their shape they have sometimes been thought to represent razors.
This coat was borne by both the Barbers and their successors, the
Barber-Surgeons, until the time of Elizabeth. The grant is as follows:--

[Illustration: Coat of arms]

  ~Be~ it knowen to all men that y Clarensew Kyng of Armes of the
  South Marche of Englond Consideryng the noble estate of the Cite of
  London by the name of Erle & Barons as in their ffirst Charter by

  avyce of all the aldermen and the noble citezenis of London that
  every alderman shuld have award by hymself to governe and rule to
  the Worship of the cite and the maires power evˀy alderman in his
  Ward with correccion of the mair beyng for the tyme and so notablie

  Barbours John Strugge Thomas Wyllote Hugh Herte & Thomas Waleys come

                                        By CLARANSEW Kynge of armes.

1492. In this year a cognizance, or possibly an informal grant of arms,
was given to the Surgeons’ Company; this is depicted on the first
leaf in the beautiful old vellum book of Ordinances at the Hall, the
inscription under, stating that it was given to the Craft of Surgeons
of London in the year 1492, at the going over the sea into France of
Henry VII. (_See_ the fac-simile at p. 69.)

No other authority than the above statement is known for this coat, but
in the grant to the Barber-Surgeons (1569) it is recited that Henry
VIII granted the Company of Surgeons a cognizance “which is a spatter
thereon a rose gules crowned golde for their warrant in fielde but
no authoritie by warrant for the bearinge of the same in shilde as
armes.” The Herald in drawing the grant of 1569 probably accidentally
put in the name of Henry VIII for that of Henry VII, the entry in our
book being undoubtedly coeval with the circumstance. We here get the
foundations of our present coat of arms; the fleams representing the
old Barber-Surgeons or Barbers, and the crowned rose and spatula the
Surgeons proper, both of which were introduced into one shield in 1561,
and quartered in 1569.

On either side of the shield of the Surgeons’ Arms stands a Saint
habited as a doctor or physician, one of whom holds a medical vessel in
his right hand, while the other has a box of ointment and a spatula,
indicative of their being professors of the healing art. These are the
patron Saints of the Company, Cosmus and Damianus. Mrs. Jameson states
that they--

  were two brothers, Arabians by birth but they dwelt in Ægæ, a city of
  Cilicia. Their father having died while they were yet children, their
  pious mother Theodora, brought them up with all diligence, and in the
  practice of every Christian virtue. Their charity was so great, that
  not only they lived in the greatest abstinence, distributing their
  goods to the infirm and poor, but they studied medicine and surgery,
  that they might be able to prescribe for the sick, and relieve the
  sufferings of the wounded and infirm; and the blessing of God being
  on all their endeavours, they became the most learned and the most
  perfect physicians that the world had ever seen. They ministered to
  all who applied to them, whether rich or poor. Even to suffering
  animals they did not deny their aid, and they constantly refused all
  payment or recompense, exercising their art only for charity and for
  the love of God; and thus they spent their days.

In the cover of a Latin Bible, printed in 1470, I discovered some
vellum padding, which on examination proved to be a MS. of XIth
century, consisting of part of a collection of the lives of the
Saints, interspersed with prayers, etc., and which probably had been
read in some Convent refectory during the hours of meals. This MS. is
moreover curious, as those portions intended to be sung have certain
signs affixed, known as “neumes,” which, before the more modern method
of musical notation was introduced, were employed to denote musical
expression. An account of the martyrdom of Cosmo and Damian, together
with their brothers, is here preserved, but as the original is in very
contracted Latin, the following translation will, perhaps, better
supply its place:--

  The souls of Cosmus and Damianus the Just are in the hands of God.

  There have moreover been crowned these five brothers Cosmus,
  Damianus, Antimeus, Leuntius and Eutrepius.

  Furthermore we beseech Thee, Almighty God, to grant that we, who
  commemorate the nativities of thy Saints Cosmus and Damianus, may by
  their intercessions be delivered from all present and future evils.
  Amen. The blessed martyrs Cosmus Damianus, Antimeus, Leuntius and
  Eutrepius, were committed to prison by order of the governor; and
  on the following day, the proconsul sitting on the judgment seat,
  caused an enormous fire to be made, and the above-named men to be
  led out of prison and cast into its midst. But on account of their
  prayers the fire lost its power over these saints. The governor was
  astounded, and the executioner, thinking that the circumstances which
  had happened with regard to the martyrs of God depended on their
  magical arts, ordered them to be again interrogated. But, when they
  remained firm with a cheerful and joyous countenance rendered more
  noble by torture, he ordered crosses to be made, and the martyrs,
  when stretched upon them, to be pelted with stones. Accordingly,
  when the blows recoiled on those that delivered them, the governor,
  inflamed with excessive rage, gave orders to attack them with arrows,
  so that at a less distance the steel might at least penetrate. But,
  although he had not been able to injure them in any way, many of
  those who discharged arrows and who stood near withdrew on account of
  the wounds that they received.

  For so is the testimony.

  Seeing accordingly that his ill will was overcome by Divine power,
  the governor ordered them to be mutilated with a sword.

  The blessed martyrs were put to death on the Twentieth day of
  September; and their bodies were buried by devout men in a holy spot
  not far from the city of Ægae.

Mrs. Jameson relates a legend somewhat similar to the above, and states
that it was of great antiquity, being transplanted into Western Europe
in the first ages of Christianity. The Emperor Justinian, having been
recovered, as he supposed, from a dangerous illness by the intercession
of these saints, erected a superb church in their honour. Among the
Greeks they succeeded to the worship and attributes of Æsculapius;
and from their disinterested refusal of all pay or reward, they are
distinguished by the honourable title of Anargyres, which signifies
moneyless, or without fees. These saints are commemorated on the 27th
September, and all over Europe have ever been the patron saints of the
Barbers and Surgeons; they are also the patrons of the Medici family,
and as such they figure on the coins of Florence.

1540. In the bowl of the grace cup given by Henry VIII to the
Barber-Surgeons, the arms of the Barbers impaling the Surgeons are cut,
but this is merely the fancy of an engraver, and of later date than the
cup.stration]

10th July, 1561. In the Heralds’ College (I.C.B., No. 101, 20) is
a grant of arms by William Harvey, Clarencieux King of Arms, to
the Barber-Surgeons, in which he grants and assigns unto them for
an “augmentac͠on to ther old and aunscint Armes (which is sables a
chevrone between thre flumes argent) a chef paly argent & vert on a
pale goles a lyon passant regardant gold betwene two spatters argent a
roze gewles crowned golde & to ther creast upon the healme an opinacus
golde standing upon a wreath argent and sables manteled gewles dubled
argent.”

[Illustration]

1565. This year, Harvey, Clarencieux, granted two supporters to the
above arms, namely, “two lynxe in their proper Collor about there necks
a crowne with a cheyne argent.”

1568. This year, Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy, Kings of Arms,
ratified and confirmed the above arms, crest, and supporters, with
the following variations, the arms to be borne quarterly, “the ffyrst
sables a cheveron bytwyne iij flewmes argent, the second quarter per
pale argent and vert on a spatter of the fyrst a Dobele rose gules and
argent crowned or, over all on a crosse gules a lyon passant Regardant
or.”

12th June, 1569. The grant of Arms by Dethick, etc., is a beautifully
artistic production, though, unfortunately, slightly damaged, and
the seals are missing. In 1885 the Company had it reproduced in
chromo-photography by Mr. William Griggs, whose work has been so
skilfully executed that it is difficult to observe the least difference
between the original and the copies.

[Illustration]

With this grant is the first appearance of a motto “De præscientia
Dei.” How this motto came to be chosen, or in what way it applies to
the Barber-Surgeons, I am at a loss to point out. The following is the
text of the grant.

  ~To~ all and singuler aswell Kinges herehaultes and Officers of
  Armes, as nobles gentlemen and others to whome these presentes shall
  come be seene heard, read or understand Sir Gilbert Dethicke Knight
  alias Garter principall Kinge of Armes, Robert Cooke Esquire alias
  Clarencieulx kinge of Armes of the South partes of Englande, and
  Willm̄ Flower Esquire alias Norroy kinge of Armes of the northe
  partes of Englande send greetinge in our lorde god everlastinge. For
  as much as aunciently from the beginninge the valiaunt and vertuouse
  actes of excellent personnes have ben com̃endid to the worlde and
  posterite with sondrey monumentes and remembrances of their good
  deseartes; Emongest the which the chiefest and most usuall hath ben
  the bearinge of signes and tokens in shildes called Armes, beinge
  none other thinges then evidences and demonstracions of prowesse and
  valoir diversly distributed accordinge to the qualytes and deseartes
  of the persons meritinge the same To thˀentent that such as have
  done com̃endable service to their prince or countrey either in warre
  or peace, or other wyse by laudable and couragiouse entreprices or
  proceedinge of eny person or persons in thˀaugmentacion of the Estate
  or com̄on wealth of their realme or countrey might thereby receyve
  due honor in their lyves, and also deryve the same succesively to
  their successors and posteritie for ever. And wheras in this Citie
  of London thˀexperience & practise of the science and facultie of
  Chirurgery is most requisite and daily to be exercysed & experimented
  for the preservacion of meny, & by thˀoccasion of the practise
  thereof meny expert persons be brought up & experimented to the
  relief, succour, & helpe of an infinite nomber of persons. And for
  as much as within this Citie of London ther were two severall
  c͠opanyes, thˀone by the name of Barbours Chirurgeons, and thˀother
  by the name of Chirurgeons onely: the Barbours Chirurgeons being
  incorporate & y{e} other not, & bothe occupyenge y{e} arte of
  Chirurgery wheruppon greate c͠otention did arise. And for y{t} it was
  most meete and necessary y{t} the sayd two c͠opanyes shuld be united
  & made one hole body & so incorporated, to thˀentent that by their
  union & often assembly togither, thˀexercyse & knowledge of their
  science & mistery might appeere, as well in practise as in speculatiõ
  not onely to theim selfes, but to others under theim. So that it was
  thought most meete & c͠ovenient upon grave & greate c͠osideracion,
  to unyte & joyne y{e} sayd two c͠opanyes in one: w{ch} was don as
  may appeere by an acte of parleament in an̄o xxxij of Henry theight
  w{t} these wordes “Be it enactid by the Kinge our souvereigne lorde
  & the lordes spirituall & temporall & the com̃ons of y{e} same, that
  y{e} sayde two severall & distinct companies, that is to say bothe
  y{e} Barbours Surgeons, & the Sourgeons & every parson of theim
  beinge a freman of either of y{e} sayde c͠opanies after y{e} custome
  of the sayde citie of London, & their successors, from hencefoorthe
  immediatly be unyted & made one entier and whole body corporate, &
  one societie perpetual, which at all tymes heerafter shalbe called by
  y{e} name of Maisters & Governours of y{e} mistery & com̃unalty of
  Barbours & Surgeons of London for evermore, & by none other name.”
  In consideracion whereof & for that it doth appeere a thinge most
  requisite for the unitinge of these two c͠opanyes togither and for
  that thˀoccupation of the Barbo{rs} Chirurgeons beinge incorporate
  hath since y{e} tyme of Kinge Henry the sixt used & boren Armes
  y{t} is to say Sables a cheveron betweene thre Flewmes argent w{ch}
  Armes wer unto theim assigned onely by the gifte & assignement
  of Clarencieulx Kinge of Armes, as by y{e} patent thereof doth &
  may more plainly appeere. And since y{e} unitinge of y{e} sayde
  two c͠opanies these Armes of y{e} sayd corporation of Barbours
  Chirurgeons hath ben used & none other, yet notw{t}standinge y{e}
  late Kinge Henry thˀeight of famouse memory assigned & gave unto y{e}
  company of y{e} Chirurgeons onely, a Cognoysance, w{ch} is a spatter,
  thereon a rose gules crowned golde, for their warrant in fielde, but
  no authoritie by warrant for the bearinge of the same in shilde as
  Armes. And for y{t} it pleased y{e} same Kinge Henry thˀeight, not
  onely to unite & incorporate these two c͠opanies togither by acte of
  parleament but also hath ratifyed & c͠ofirmed the same by his letters
  patentꝭ under the greate seale of Englande & so lately c͠ofirmed
  by y{e} Queenes Ma{tie} that now is.[281] And wheras Thomas Galle
  in the 3 yere of the Queene’s Ma{ties} reigne that now is beinge
  Maister, Alexander Mason John Standon Robert Mudesley governors of
  y{e} same corporation mistery & comunaltie of Barbours & Chirurgeons
  being desirouse to have some signes & tokens addid & augmented to
  thˀold & auncient Armes of the Barbours Chirurgeons, not onely for a
  perpetuall memory as well of y{e} famouse prince Kinge Henry thˀeight
  their founder & patrone but also for a further declaration of y{e}
  unitinge of those two c͠opanies togither did instantly require the
  late Clarencieulx Hervy to consider y{e} premisses & to shew his
  endevor therein. Who finding their request just and lawfull did
  graunt & give unto them by his letters patentes under his hand &
  seale bearinge date the x{th} of July in the third yere of y{e}
  reigne of the queenes Ma{tie} that now is, an augmentacˀon in chief
  to their olde & auncient Armes w{th} heaulme & Creast to the same:
  which chief was paly argent & vert on a pale gules a lyon passant
  gardant golde betweene two spatters argent, on eche a double rose
  gules and argent crowned golde: and to their Creast on a torce silver
  and sables an Opinacus golde: Mantelled gules, doubled argent. And
  further in the tyme of Robert Balthrop Esquire serjeaunt of the
  Queenes Ma{ties} Chirurgeons then beinge Maister of the sayd mistery
  and comunalty of the Barbours & Chirurgeons and George Vaughan
  Richard Hughes & George Corron governours of the same corporation
  the sayd Clarencieulx Hervy did graunt unto the sayd corporation
  two supporters to those Armes before given them: which were two
  Linxe in their proper coulor, aboute their neckes a Crowne w{t} a
  chayne argent pendant therat: As by the sayde letters patentes more
  plainly doth appeere. YET NOTWITHSTANDINGE for as much as it doth
  plainly appeere unto us the sayd Garter Clarencieulx & Norroy Kinges
  of Armes, that the aforesayd Armes in some respectes wer not onely
  contrary to the wordes of the corporation of the sayd Barbours and
  Chirurgeons but that also in the same patent of Armes ther ar sondrey
  other thinges contrary and not agreinge with the auncient lawes &
  rules of Armes: We the sayd Kinges of Armes by power & authoritie to
  us com̃itted by Letters patent under the greate Seale of Englande,
  have confirmed given and graunted the foresayd Armes Creast and
  Supporters heertofore mentioned, to be boren in maner and fourme
  heerafter specified. That is to say: Quarterly the first sables a
  cheveron betweene three Flewmes argent: the seconde quarter per pale
  argent and vert on a Spatter of the first, a double Rose gules and
  argent crowned golde: the third quarter as the seconde and the fourth
  as the first: Over all on a Crosse gules a lyon passant gardant

  [281] This statement is incorrect. The Act of Parliament was passed
        in 1540, but was not confirmed by any letters patent of Henry
        VIII. We have no such charter or any reference to it, and
        moreover it is _not on the Patent Rolls_, where it would
        appear, had it ever existed; furthermore Elizabeth’s charter
        (in our possession) confirms Henry’s charter of 1512 and not
        this pretended one.

It will be observed that this grant recites that it plainly appeared
that the grant of 10th July, 1561, was [_a._] contrary to the words
of the Corporation (_i.e._, Incorporation) of the said Barbers and
Surgeons, and [_b._] contrary to and not agreeing with the ancient laws
and rules of arms.

With regard to the former assertion [_a._] I take it that the grant
being made to the “Master and Governors of the Corporation Mystery
and Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons” and _not_ to the “Masters
and Governors of the Mystery and Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons
of London” as they are styled in the Act 32 Hen. VIII, offended the
precise Heralds of 1569, and that it was indeed a technical defect and
contrary to the exact words of the incorporation.

As to the second point [_b._] there cannot be any doubt but that Hervey
committed a violation of one of the fundamental and most ancient laws
of heraldry, viz., that colour must not be on colour (nor metal on
metal). He gave the Company on their old sable field, a chief with
gules and vert thereon! This greatly shocked old Garter, Clarencieux,
and Norroy, and enabled them, whilst recording the blunder of one of
their predecessors, to extract a good fee from the Barber-Surgeons for
a new grant.

FEASTS.


There is a wide-spread impression that the Livery Guilds exist
principally for the purpose of feasting, and there are unscrupulous
persons who do not hesitate to affirm that the Courts of the Companies
act as fraudulent trustees, and are consenting parties to the
malversation of trust and charity property, eating up money which it is
audaciously pretended belongs to the “people of London.”

These statements have been assiduously put forth by a certain class of
politicians whose acquaintance with the true details of the case must
be absolutely nil, and who it is but reasonable to suppose, are willing
to assume that the gentlemen who manage the affairs of the Companies
are in the habit of acting as their traducers would do, had they but
the opportunity.

To any one conversant with the history and management of the Livery
Guilds, these assertions are known to be false. Here and there, as
in every concern in life, improprieties and errors in judgment may
have occurred, but it is confidently asserted, and capable of proof,
that no charitable or trust funds suffer from feasting; indeed, on
the contrary, the practice has obtained for centuries, with but few
exceptions, for the members of the guilds to themselves supply the
funds which are spent upon their entertainment, and for the surplus
accumulations of these funds to be applied _to the augmentation of
charities and trusts_. It has certainly been so in the Barber-Surgeons’
Company, and for a long period the calls upon the Livery for feasting
purposes (when the custom was to nominate Stewards in rotation) were
a severe strain upon the members, and occasioned great irritation and
ill-feeling.

The earliest practice in the Companies would appear to be that the
Livery and their wives attending the feasts, paid a stipulated sum per
head, and we know this by our records to have been so in our Company
long before the time of Richard II. This custom was altered in later
times, and we find that certain appointed entertainments were given on
fixed days, to which all members were invited, and which were paid for
by fines laid down upon admission to the freedom, and further fines on
going on to the Livery and Court. In addition to this, each Liveryman
had, in his turn, to serve “the office of Steward,” that is, to join
with four or five others in providing the costs of certain dinners.[282]

[282] The office of Steward is not now served, but each Liveryman on
admission pays a special fine of fifteen guineas in lieu, which is
applied towards the cost of the entertainments.

The fees on admission into the Companies are greatly in excess of the
ancient ones, and it is mainly from this source of revenue that the
expenses of the feasts are now defrayed. It is so in the Barbers’
Company, but, if at any time these funds have temporarily been found
insufficient for the purpose, they have been supplemented from a
property, which is in no sense a Charity Estate, or subject to any
trust whatsoever.

There have been and are, good men of business on the Courts, and by
prudent investments of surplus funds derived from fees, fines, etc., a
property has been created, which is exclusively their very own to deal
with as they please. We have, amongst many others, the opinion of Lord
Chancellor Selborne very decisively to this effect, and also one, which
by the traducers of the Companies ought to be respected, for it is that
of Sir Horace Davey, Q.C., who was consulted by the Livery Companies’
Commission--a Commission notoriously hostile to the guilds. Sir H.
Davey stated that they would “not be justified in recommending that
the corporate property of the Companies should be taken from them by
the State.” He further reported that, such an act “would be an act of
_confiscation_, and would not unreasonably shake the confidence of the
owners of property in the security of the rights of property. It must
be remembered that the Estates of these Companies have been recognised,
and held by the Courts of Law, to be as much their property with a
full right of disposition, as the property of individuals.” Truly, the
Commissioners must have said to their legal adviser as Balak of old
said to Baalam, “I took thee to curse mine enemies, and behold thou
hast blessed them altogether!”

It is a pleasing characteristic of all true Englishmen that they love
to meet together around a festive board; while their hospitality in
inviting their friends, or the eminent and great in all sections of
society to partake with them has happily not gone out of fashion, and,
spite of the sour critics of the guilds, we fervently trust that it
never may.

1388. In the return to a writ, 12th Richard II, the Masters of the
Barbers certified, amongst other matters, that it was their practice
“once a year to assemble to feast,” and that they had an ordinance by
which none of the brotherhood were to pay more than 14_d._ each towards
the feast.

10th May, 1435. Among the Ordinances of the Surgeons was one that each
member was to “paie ʒeerli to the dyner of the craft that is to seie
oonys aʒeer on the dai of Seint luke ech man lich mich whethir he be
pˀsent or absent,” _i.e._, once a year on St. Luke’s day each man was
to pay like much whether present or absent.

28th September, 1503. It was ordained that every member attending the
dinner the day on which the Wardens were presented to the Lord Mayor
was to pay 20_d._, and if he brought his wife with him, then 2_s._

The Barber-Surgeons from the earliest times appear to have entertained
the ladies at certain feasts, and their unique toast “The Good Wives,
Merry Maids and Buxom Widows of the Worshipful Company of Barbers” is
traditionally said to have had its origin in Elizabeth’s time.

14th May, 1530. The following is amongst the ordinances signed by Sir
Thomas More at this date--

  AND WHERE OF OLDE Custume yerely upon the Sondaye next ensuyng the
  ffeaste of Seynt Bartholomew the appostell[283] a dyner is kept
  and provyded for theym of the lyvery of the said Company in their
  Comen halle called Barbors hale AND ON the daye of saynt Cosme &
  Damian[284] yf it be not on the saterday a dynˀ for them of the same
  compani owt of the lyverey IT IS ordeyned and enacted that evˀy man
  that hathe been upper maister or upper Govˀnor of the said Company
  shall paye at and for the same dyner xij{d} for hymselff and viij{d}
  for his wyffe yff she come. And evˀy other man beying of the lyverey
  of the same Company shall paye in likewyse for hym selffe viij{d} and
  for his wyffe yff she come iiij{d.} Provided alwaye that the maisters
  or Govˀnors of the said Company for the tyme beyng shall paye nothing
  for their wyffꝭ comyng to the dyner for that yere fforasmoche as
  their Wyffꝭ must of necessitte be theire to helpe that evˀy thyng
  theire be sett in ordre. And that evˀy man of the said Company beyng
  owt of the lyverey shall pay at and for his dyner on the said morowe
  viij{d} and for his wyffe yff she come iiij{d.}

  [283] 24th August.
  [284] 27th September.

8th July, 1552. The earliest entry in the Court Minutes on this subject
is a doleful one, for it was ordered “That there shalbe no dynner kept
this yere.”

19th September, 1552. William Bette was appointed “Cooke for the Hall,”
and Steven Reede the “Butler.” John Edwards (a Freeman) was to supply
the flowers on the feast days.

28th July, 1555. It was ordered that the Masters should have a yearly
allowance of £7 for the Election dinner, and that none should be at the
dinner but Liverymen.

22nd July, 1556. This allowance was increased to £13 6_s._ 8_d._

20th February, 1567. Henry Smith, yeoman to Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of
Leicester, was admitted to the freedom, and because he had been frankly
and freely admitted to the freedom of the City at the suit of the Duke
of Norfolk, the Marquess of Northampton and the Earl of Leicester, he
paid nothing but 3_s._ 4_d._, and 4_d._ for entering his name--

  but the same daye the saide Henry Smythe gave the M{r} & govˀnor{rs}
  and assystentˀ a dynar at his owne pˀpr coste & charges franckely and
  gratefully and also he hath forder more pˀmysed and graunted to geve
  one boock[285] of season to serve at the dynar upon the daye of the
  Electyon.

  [285] Buck.

  28th July, 1593. No greate dyner was agreed upon but a smale repast
  w{th} the allowance of xl{s} and nether wemen nor children to come to
  o{r} hall upon the daie of the newe ellec̃ion.

25th August, 1600. There having been abuses at the feasts, an order was
made for their reformation which stated--

  that the bodye of this Company hath susteyned much disparagement
  by reason that some of the livery and others noe white at all
  respectinge the worshipp of this Company have not onely by themselves
  but alsoe by their servants and apprentices disfurnished the tables
  att ffeastes whereat they have sitten to pleasure their private
  frendes contrary to all modestie and good government. Doe therefore
  order for reformac͠on thereof by the aucthoritye aforesaid That noe
  pˀson of the Lyvery of this Companye beinge not of the Assistaunce of
  the same, shall not att any tyme hereafter suffer any of his children
  frendes servants or apprentices to staye or attende uppon him or his
  wiefe att any ffeaste to be kepte in the saide Comon Hall [_under a
  penalty of 6s. 8d._].

An order was also made that no Assistant should have more than one
servant or apprentice to attend upon him and his wife at any feast.

  21st January, 1601. Whereas by the death of Robert Gray late Cooke
  to this Company the house was unfurnished of a Cooke to serve the
  said mistery And therefore divers Cookes became this daie shewters
  to this Courte for the place of the said Robert Gray beinge then
  voyd, yet notwithstandinge forasmuch as Margaret Grey wiefe to the
  said Robert Grey became an humble Suter to the said Courte for the
  same place, it was ordered by the whole consente of this Courte That
  the said Margeret Grey be admitted Cooke to this Company duringe the
  tyme she shall well and honestlie and sufficientlie behave her selfe
  therin And she to receave such fee and salary therefore as at any
  tyme heretofore hath beene graunted to the said Robert Grey Provided
  allwaies that she finde all vessells belongeinge to a Cooke And that
  she execute the said place by a sufficient deputy beinge such a
  pˀsonn as the M{rs} of this Company for the tyme beinge shall like
  well of and shall thinke fitt.

Margery, however, does not seem to have “honestlie and sufficientlie
behaved her selfe,” for as appears by an entry--

  6th May, 1602. This daye Margery Grey late wyef to Robert Grey was
  dismissed from being any more Coocke to this Company for speciall
  causes to the M{rs} best knowen.

The Plague was raging severely in London in 1603, and the following
precept was addressed to the Company, who however seem to have
disregarded it, as the Election and Audit dinners were held this
year. It is only fair, however, to state that the Court disbursed
considerable sums of money amongst the poor stricken people.

    13th April, 1603. BY THE MAIOR.

  6th January, 1609. This daye it is ordered that none of the officers
  wyves shall at any tyme hereafter followe the M{rs} to places where
  they dyne w{th}out the M{rs} consentꝭ uppon payne of the M{rs}
  displeasures.

1609. The dinners were usually held on Election and Audit days, on
Lord Mayor’s day, and after all public dissections, besides Committee
dinners (which usually were at taverns), and this year it was ordered
that a dinner was to be held on “Gunpowder Day.”

  21st August, 1609. This day it was ordered that from henceforth all
  such as are of the Livery should give towardꝭ the charge of the
  musicke on the Election day vj{d} a peice which they then begun and
  confirmed.

The reason of the next order was, that in consequence of the poverty of
the Company at this time, the usual allowance of £8 made by the Court
towards the Mayor’s feast, could not be granted.

  2nd October, 1610. At this Court Richard Cade & Richard Coopˀ whoe
  are appoynted for Stewardꝭ of the Mayors ffeast are contented at
  theire owne chardgꝭ to provide and make the same ffeast as fully as
  formˀly y{t} hath been, only this their provision for their quantitie
  of their messes are not to be soe many for that noe wyves nor guestꝭ
  are to be bydden or brought to the same ffeast.

  18th September, 1611. Att this Court Sebright the Cook is dismissed
  from his place of beinge Cook to this howse as well for that he did
  dresse their last dynner very badlie as for his ill usage in speeches
  towardꝭ the maisters wyves and for dyvˀse other abuses by him
  heretofore committed.

  2nd July, 1612. At this Court our M{r} & M{r} Warden Johnson moving
  this Court that the Barbors as well as the Surgeons might be bedden
  to the dynnˀs that are keept at the examinac͠on of surgeons whereupon
  it was at this Court ordered & agreed that as many of the Auntient
  M{rs} & govˀno{rs} being barbo{rs} should & shalbe bidde unto every
  such dynner as there shalbe Surgeons beinge examiners at evˀy such
  dynner.

21st January, 1613. It was ordered that the Master and Wardens, with
four of the Ancient Masters, should for the “worship & credytt of this
Company,” yearly go and visit the Lord Mayor at dinner, and that 20_s._
each should be allowed them for their “charges” of the same. This
allowance of 20_s._ each was probably given to some officer of the Lord
Mayor to secure his favour towards the Company.

6th February, 1613. An order was made that at the dinner after any
private anatomy, any of the Livery, either Barbers or Surgeons, might
come thereto on payment of 12_d._ each.

  16th September, 1613. This daie it is thought fitt & ordered that
  the widdowes of this company w{ch} doe paie their quarterage shalbe
  bidden to the ffeastꝭ in the hall.

  14th October, 1613. Att this Court it is ordered that such widdowes
  as have been masters wyves and doe keepe shoppes or bynd appnˀtices
  shall paye their quarteradge but for such as doe neither keepe
  shoppes nor bynd appnˀticꝭ they shall not paye any quarteradge And
  yet notw{th}standinge they shalbe bydden to the feastꝭ yerelie.

  24th May, 1614. Whereas this Company hath receaved a preceptt from
  the lord Mayor of this citty forbidding thereby all superfluitie &
  excesse of Dyet at the ffeastꝭ of this company and thereby injoyning
  that such feastꝭ as accustomably have been made & provided by this
  Company shalbe hereafter keept more sparingly & frugally then in
  former tymes they have, Wherefore it is ordered that there shalbe
  keept & made on the ellection daie this yere ensuing a smale
  ellection dynner according to the tenor of the said precept.

25th August, 1614. The above precept soon being forgotten it was this
day ordered--

  that there shalbe kept an Auditt dynner in such manner & forme as
  formerlie in other yeares have byn accustomed. And such allowance as
  formerlie hath byn allowde is to be paid by the howse.

  10th July, 1615. At this Court it is ordered that the Cooke shalbe
  removed & displaced from his place of beinge Cooke of this Companie
  not onely for that he hath abused and wronged manie who have byn
  M{rs} & Stewardꝭ of the feastꝭ in unsemelie wordꝭ but for a generall
  dislike taken against him by this howse & for not pˀforminge his
  office in such sorte as is right he shold & ought to doe.

1624. The funds being very low this year the Court held no election
dinner, but regaled themselves with cakes and wine, and the following
order was made for the Yeomanry:--

  2nd September, 1624. This Court being moved whether the yeomanry of
  y{is} Compa. should hould any election dinner or noe. It is for the
  reason then shewne expressely ordered with a generall consent that
  the yeomanry shall onely keepe their Election as this Court lately
  did onely with Cakes and wyne and neither feast musick or sermon to
  be had at that time.

  20th July, 1625. This daye the letter directed to this Companye
  from my lord Maio{r} of London in effect tending the prohibiting
  of publicke feastingꝭ in our Hall and the contributeing of those
  moneys that should be saved thereby the one halfe to be paid unto the
  chamber of London and the other halfe to the poore of our Companie,
  so hereupon it is ordered by this Courte y{t} Ten poundꝭ shalbe
  distributed to the poore of this Companie at the discretion of the
  present M{rs} & noe money at all to be paid into the Chamber of
  London.

  10th July, 1628. This daye our M{r} propounding to this Court whether
  there should be a greate Election dinner or a small dinner or onely
  Cakes and wine upon the next Election daye for choise of new M{rs},
  whereupon by most voyces it was ordered that there should be a greate
  Election dinner held this yeare and the allowance of xx{li} towardꝭ
  that charge to be defrayed.

  28th January, 1631. This Court being informed of Swinnertons abusive
  and naughtie pewter from tyme to tyme brought to serve this Hall at
  feastꝭ doe dismisse him from serving that place any longer.

  Governo{rs} that are Surgians shalbe at the charge and give the
  venison that shalbe used at their solepñe[287] feasts and those twoe
  Governo{rs} Surgians and the other twoe Governo{rs} Barbars to paye
  joynetly & sevˀally share and share like amongst them 4 the charge
  for fees and fetching the venison soe to be brought to o{r} Hall.

  brothers of this Company were invited to dine here when M{r} Die
  made his dinner that the fare was enlarged. It is ordered that that
  addic͠on of fare amounting to 50{s} shalbe allowed out of the stock.

  6th April, 1638. Whereas the Companie intendeth to invite the Lords

  20th June, 1638. Upon the complaint of the losse of a silver spoone
  the last dinner in the Hall and diver other times napkins & pewter
  dishes this Court doth order that when dinner goes in, the outer
  Wickett doore shalbe alwayes locked & the key thereof brought in and
  layed by o{r} M{r} for the time being till dinner be ended & the
  plate naperye & dishes gathered up & soe discharged.

The next entry would seem to indicate that some previous gift for the
purchase of books had unhappily been diverted into a wrong channel.

  2nd March, 1640. £6 given by Mistress Napkin & Mistriss Eaton is
  absolutely ordered to buy bookes & not disbursed or dispended in
  Drinking.

The following circumstance is significant, as exactly one hundred years
later the separation which Mr. Foster desired, and for which he got
into trouble, became an accomplished fact.

6th November, 1645. Mr. Ralph Foster was complained of for refusing to
make his dinner to the Court on his election as an Assistant, and he
thereupon uttered certain speeches “tending to the separation of the
Barbers from the Surgeons,” for which he was reprimanded, whereupon he
promised to make his dinner and to say no more about disunion.

23rd October, 1649. Upon reading the precept requiring the Livery to
attend the Lord Mayor Elect to Westminster in their Barge, it was
ordered that the Livery should be warned to perform that service in
accordance with old custom, and “that there be a ffeast at the Hall
on that day for the said Livery, But in respect of the hardnes and
troubles of the times this Court doth consent that there be noe second
course and noe Woeman at the same ffeast.”

Among the Company’s archives are four books containing many details
of the feasts held between the years 1676 and 1790. They appear to
have been kept by the various cooks, probably under the direction of
the Clerk, and the following gleanings from them will be found to be
replete with interest.

The allowance to the “musick” at nearly every dinner was a shoulder of
mutton, sometimes supplemented by two rabbits. The cost of “dressing”
the monthly dinners was usually about 8_s._, and of the Election, Audit
and quarterly Courts £1 10_s._ to £4.

20th September, 1709. It was ordered, in consequence of the great
increase in the Livery, that there should be six instead of five
stewards of the Mayor’s Feast to make the Livery dinner, and any
liveryman chosen to the office and refusing to serve was to be
prosecuted under the by-laws. The fine for not serving was £13 6_s._
8_d._, and was invariably enforced, numerous cases of refusal being
decided at law in favour of the Company. Six Whifflers were as usual,
appointed “to be attendant upon the Govern{rs} at the Hall upon the
next Lord Mayo{rs} day in comely & decent Apparrell with gilded Chaines
& white Staves.”

6th November, 1717. In consequence of irregularities at the Lord
Mayor’s feast, it was ordered that in future the Stewards should be
prohibited from bringing their wives and friends to the dinner.

1721. The third dinner book opens with an account of the receipts
of the Governors’ “Potation Money” for this year, amounting to £131
11_s._ 2_d._, the contributions being from Barbers one guinea, and from
Surgeons two guineas each. This potation money was spent at the Mitre
Tavern in Fleet Street, on ten Monthly Court dinners, which averaged
the modest sum of £4 4_s._ apiece, and the remainder was disbursed
about the election feast, wine and sundries.

The cost of the Mayor’s feast this year was £67 7_s._, and at this
dinner was drunk a hogshead of port (query), six gallons of mountain,
six gallons of white port, and three gallons of canary.

July 19th, 1722. At the ladies’ feast the following wine was drunk--

  30 Gallons Red Port at 7_s._                                 10 10 0
  11   "     Sherry at 7_s._                                    3 17 0
   7   "     Canary at 7_s._                                    2  9 0
   5   "     Rhenish at 7_s._                                   1 15 0

and 4_s._ were expended on tobacco and pipes.

1726. The monthly Court dinners were held at the George and Vulture
Tavern, nine of them costing in all £29 13_s._ 9_d._

The Election dinner this year cost £91 8_s._ 0_d._

And the Lord Mayor’s feast £72 1_s._ 10-1/2_d._

June, 1729. The monthly Court dinner was held at “Vaux Hall.”

The accounts throughout the Third Dinner Book (1720-1740) appear to
be much the same every year. First is a list of receipts for Potation
Money, averaging about £100 per annum, then follow the allowances out
of the same towards the Election dinner, the dressing it and use of
pewter, about £19 in all, the payments for the monthly Court dinners
(nine or ten at about £4 4_s._ each), and the expenses of the Election
feasts, about £80 to £90 a piece.

The cost of the Lord Mayor’s feast, the Livery feast, and the Ladies’
feast, was borne by the Stewards.

There were gay doings at some of these dinners, as witness the
following:

  1726. Paid the Boy who danced the anticks at the Lady’s feast, 5_s._

  1727. By Cash paid the Butchers who played to the Company with their
  Marrow bones and cleavers on Lord Mayor’s day, 1_s._

And there were sometimes rather shady doings after the dinners, thus:

  10th July, 1729. Mem̃dm. M{r} Truelove & M{r} Fradin carried away
  y{e} next morning after y{e} feast four Dozen Quarts of Wine, One
  whole Venison pasty, One whole Goose, one whole fowl, & several
  lemons & sugar.

1st February, 1732. Mr. John Atkinson and the other Stewards of the
Mayor’s feast, employed a cook of their own, and “did make a most
scandalous Dinner for y{e} Co.,” whereupon order was given that in
future no other than the “Standing Cooke” of the Company should be
employed.

One is astounded at the quantity of wine which appears to have been
imbibed at some of these dinners; take, for example, the following on
Lord Mayor’s Day, 1735, and note that it is especially stated that the
wine was “drank at the said feast”:

  Paid for the following quantitys of wine provided for and drank at
  the said feast, viz{t.}

By the above account these thirsty old Barber-Surgeons seem to have
consumed no less than 79 Gallons of wine at this dinner.

15th July, 1736. 56 gallons of wine were drunk at the Ladies’ feast.

  21st July, 1726. It is order{d} That from henceforward at all publick
  Feasts or Dinners to be held or made at the Hall the Cook of the
  Company for the time being shall before he sends the Dinner into the
  Hall deliver to the Clark of the Company at his House his Messe of
  meat consisting of six compleat dishes according to the Ancient laws
  and usage of the Company in that behalf the same being the ancient
  ffee & Perquisite of the Clerk.

21st August, 1729. The above order was vacated in consequence of
disputes as to the contents and number of the dishes supplied to the
Clerk, and it was ordered that the Clerk should receive £5 5_s._
annually in lieu of his “messe of meat,” and also that he should dine
at all the feasts “as he has always been accustomed to do.”

  1st February, 1731. For the better regulating of the Ladys Feast It
  is ordered That every Member of the Court of Assistants shall besides
  his Lady and one daughter have three tickets to be delivered to such
  persons as they shall think fitt to be admitted to come and dance at
  the Hall at Five of the Clock on that day and that there shall be two
  Constables to attend at the Hall gate and see that nobody is admitted
  but with such Ticketts and that the Ticketts be made out by the Clerk
  of the Company and sealed with the Company’s seal.

The Summons to a Liveryman to take upon himself the office of Steward
was of a very peremptory nature, as will be seen by the following:--

    S{r}

  By order of the Ma{rs} or Gov{rs} of the Mystery & Comonalty of
  Barbers & Surgeons of London, I do hereby give you notice that you
  having been chosen & admitted of the Livery or Cloathing of the said
  Company, You are appointed by the Masters or Gov{rs} of the s{d}
  Comp{d} together with M{r.} Richard Penton M{r.} Joseph Griffin M{r.}
  Daniel Pengrove and M{r.} Joseph Mitchell who are also Liverymen of
  the said Company to make an Entertainment in the Com̄on Hall of the
  said Company situate in Monckwell Street in the Parish of Saint Olave
  Silver Street in the City of London for the Gov{rs} and Assistants
  of the s{d} Company commonly called the Livery Dinner on Teusday the
  3{d} day of June 1735 at two of the Clock in the afternoon pursuant
  to a By law of the said Company in that behalf made & provided. And
  in case you shall neglect or refuse w{th}out reasonable Excuse to
  join together with the said M{r.} Richard Penton M{r.} Joseph Griffin
  M{r.} Daniel Pengrove and M{r.} Joseph Mitchell to made such Dinner
  on Teusday the 3{d} day of June next, or to contribute and pay your
  share and and proporc͠on of the charges thereof you will forfeit and
  pay to the said Ma{rs} or Gov{rs} of the s{d} Mystery and Comonalty
  to the use of the said Company the sum of £5. And I do hereby give
  you further notice That the gentlemen who are to join with you in
  making the said dinner will meet you at the George and Vulture Tavern
  in Saint Michael’s Alley in Cornhill in the City of London on Friday
  next being the 23rd day of this instant May at six of the clock in
  the afternoon to give the proper directions for the said dinner, at
  which time and place you are desired to attend for that purpose.

                            I am S{r}
                                    Your most obed{t.} humble Serv{t.}
                                               CHA: BERNARD
                                          Clerk to the s{d} Company.

  Herewith you will receive a copy of the Bill of Fare or a Particular
  of w{ch} the s{d} Entertainment is to consist.

  Barbers and     }
  Surgeon’s Hall, } 22{d} May 1735

  To M{r.} Cha: More.

28th May, 1741. By an order made this day in reference to the Ladies’
feast it was directed--

  that the Entertainment shall continue no longer than twelve of the
  clock when there shall be no more Dancing but that the Musick be then
  dismissed and the Company depart.

  28th August, 1741. The Court having taken into consideration the ill
  behaviour and abusive language of John Atkinson Distiller in White
  Chappell (a Liveryman of this Company) on the last day of Election,
  who in a most gross manner (in the Common Hall of this Company) the
  Master of the said Company did greatly insult and abuse and did
  otherwise very indecently and rudely behave to other Members of the
  Company whereby the Peace of the said Company then assembled was
  greatly disturbed, and being determined to put a stop to and prevent
  the like grievances for the future by punishing all such offendors
  herein ORDERED that the said John Atkinson be fined for such his ill
  behaviour to the Master the sum of 6{s} 8{d} and 10{s} for bringing
  in to Dinner on that day another person with him after having been
  acquainted by the Master that the same was contrary to the By laws of
  the said Company.

1745. It is noticeable that the Potation Money fell off on the
separation of the Surgeons from the Barbers. During the three or four
preceding years the amount had been steadily running down from an
average of £105 to £57, and there seems to have been no Election or
Livery Dinners this year, though the gallant Barbers did not forget the
Ladies, for they gave them (and themselves) a dinner at a cost of £52
1_s._ 9_d._

The Barbers, too, at this time do not seem to have drunk quite so much
wine as the Barber-Surgeons did, and in the year 1747 is the first
mention of Beer, when 12_s._ was paid for a barrel of small Beer for
the Lord Mayor’s feast, and only 68 bottles of wine were consumed on
this occasion.

Between the years 1750 and 1786 no records are kept of any but the
Mayor’s feasts, though doubtless the Company did not fast during the
intervals.

There is now a striking similarity in these dinner accounts year by
year; usually there were six stewards each of whom provided, about the
years 1775, and later on, no less than 53 bottles of wine each, thus
emulating their predecessors the Barber-Surgeons; there are numerous
references to these bottles as being quarts, so that about 80 gallons
must have been drunk at each dinner. Happily, all this is now changed.

It is noticeable from the earliest times that the Company on every
occasion of a feast, invariably hired their Pewter dishes and plates
at great cost; it seems strange that this continual outlay should have
been incurred, instead of keeping a stock of pewter.

1830 and 1831. Considerable difficulty had arisen for some years past
in procuring Stewards for the Mayor’s feasts, and also in enforcing
the fines for not serving, whereupon a resolution was passed that
Liverymen refusing to pay the Steward’s fine would not be invited to
the dinners, and would be declared ineligible to come on the Court.

The Court seem to have had grave doubts as to the efficacy of their
By-Laws in recovering at law the Steward’s fines, and a case having
been prepared it was submitted to Sir James Scarlett and to Sir Thomas
Denman (the Attorney General). The opinion of the former eminent
Counsel, dated 10th October, 1832, is set out in the minutes, and he
appears to have been very clear that they would not be recoverable,
whereupon the Court ordered a letter (of 16th October) to be addressed
to the Livery, informing them of the difficulty which had arisen by
reason of Liverymen refusing to serve as Stewards in their rotation
(after having partaken of the hospitality of other Stewards in former
years), and that in consequence thereof there would be no dinner that
year. The day after this letter was sent out, Sir Thomas Denman’s
opinion was handed in, and was to the opposite effect of that given by
Sir James Scarlett! Since this period, and now, the Steward’s fine is
paid on the admission of a Liveryman, and thus a source of constant
annoyance is done away with.

THE IRISH ESTATE.


The history of the acquisition by the Corporation of London and the
City Guilds, of their estates in Ireland has been often related,
and full accounts will be found in “Malcolm’s Londinium Redivivum,”
“Herbert’s Livery Companies,” “Nicholl’s Ironmongers’ Company,” and
other works; I shall, therefore, only treat of the subject so far as
the Barber-Surgeons were concerned.

In 1609 when James I floated his Irish scheme, our Company seems
to have been very loath to enter into it, as would appear by the
insignificant subscriptions proffered by the Members (_see_ page 473).

The difficulty which the Court foresaw in raising the £100 demanded in
July, 1609, was endeavoured to be surmounted by the following ingenious
proposition: there had been some previous forced loans to the King
amounting to £123, for which the Company held the City’s bond, and
as this was considered a doubtful asset, it was suggested that £100
thereof should be adventured on behalf of the Company; it is needless
to say that this innocent suggestion was scouted, and a peremptory
precept for the £100 delivered, whereupon the Court assessed the
various members of the Company and with the greatest difficulty £30 was
thus raised and a further sum of £90 later on. The Minutes referring to
these transactions are especially worthy the perusal of those persons
who claim the estates of the City Companies as being the “property of
the people,” or as having been “left for the poor,” &c. We see by them
that (in our Company certainly, and as doubtless an examination of
records would show, in all other Companies) the purchase of these lands
in Ireland was not only compulsory, but that it was made from moneys
contributed by individual members for the most part, and the balance
from the “Stock of the house,” this “Stock” being the floating funds
in the Renter Warden’s hands, derived from admissions, fines, &c. We
thus see that no “trust” money was used for the purchase, and that the
estates are saddled with no trust whatever, but are held free, and by
an infinitely better title as far as morality goes, to say nothing of
legality, than many Estates in the hands of some of the aristocratic
patrons of the busybodies bent on spoliation.

In January, 1611, the Company were commanded by precept to elect
whether they would for their contribution accept a tract of land in
Ulster, _saddled with a condition to build upon it_, or refer the
letting of it to the Irish Society, whereupon they chose the latter,
and in July following came a precept, for its morality worthy of the
Land League, for it called upon the Wardens to pay down £60 more, or
else _to absolutely lose the £120 already contributed_!

The doleful answer of the Court, dated 19th July, 1611, is deeply
interesting, and we cannot but be touched by the wrongs under which
they suffered, and which constrained them to write:--“we must be
forced (yf there be lawfull authoritie to take awaye & compell o{r}
Company) to loose the moneys we have alreadye disburssed.”

James, however, did not care much about the money the Company proposed
to abandon; what he required was a further supply, and the proceedings
thereupon are indicated by the Minute of 16th November, 1611. Shortly
after, the Company wisely applied to “M{r} Recorder” to construe the
answer, but even his skill and interest did not avail, for on 2nd July,
1612, it was agreed that the Master and Wardens should go before the
Court of Aldermen, and “stand hardlie” against paying any more money,
especially as they had not any security for what had been already
advanced, and if committed, they were to go to prison, rather than pay
the £30 demanded, with a proviso that directly they were imprisoned,
the £30 was to be paid, and it was eventually paid.

In 1613, the Company made over their interest in the Irish Estate to
one of the Wardens, Mr. Allen, but this arrangement was subsequently
annulled.

Many more were the precepts, and the troubles in which the Company were
involved, about this business, but it is satisfactory to record that in
1623 £11 9_s._ 6_d._ was received on account of rents, and in 1625 a
further sum of £10 0_s._ 8_d._

The Company were, and are still, associated in their Irish Estates with
the Ironmongers’, Brewers’, Scriveners’, Coopers’, Pewterers’, and
Carpenters’ Companies; but by far the largest proportion appertains to
the Ironmongers, who have always managed the property.

In 1635, the Attorney General exhibited a Bill in the Star Chamber
against all of the Companies to the intent that they should surrender
up all their rights and evidences touching the Irish plantation, and on
our Company taking Counsel’s opinion, they were advised to submit to
this monstrous piece of injustice. Judgment was given in 1637, and the
Irish property of all the Companies was seized into the King’s hands.
One would have thought that this flagitious iniquity might have ended
here, but by the decree of the Star Chamber, the Citizens, in addition
to the loss of their Estates, were fined £8,000 to the King, and on
the 8th November, 1638, our unhappy predecessors were assessed at, and
had to pay £64 on this account, the Ironmongers paying £272, and other
Companies according to their settled proportions.

Notwithstanding these high-handed proceedings, the Barber-Surgeons,
ever ready to aid those in distress, voluntarily gave in 1642, what to
them in those dire days of taxation was a munificent gift, namely £20,
towards the relief of the poor Protestants in the north of Ireland, and
they further raised, under compulsion, by the sale of their plate and
the mortgage of their property, £400, which was “_lent_ for the Relief
of Ireland upon the faith and order of Parliament,” and not one penny
of which was ever refunded!

The illegal seizures of the Irish lands in 1637 were set aside by
Charles II, who, by his Charter, 10th April, 1662, restored and
confirmed to the citizens all their former privileges and their
possessions in Ireland, and thus our Company became repossessed of its
original property there.

A little previous to 1840 communications passed between the Barbers
and the Ironmongers’ Companies, in reference to an appointment which
had been made by the latter Company, of Mr. Oseland as Manager of the
associated estate at a salary of £400 per annum. This appointment
seems to have been made without the knowledge or concurrence of the
associated Companies, and led to some little friction, but it was no
doubt a wise step, and appears, after various protests, to have been
finally acquiesced in.

Our property known as the “Lizard Estate,” was on lease for lives,
the sole surviving life being the then Bishop of Meath, who was 76
years of age. The Ironmongers, in the natural expectation of an early
reversion to the estate, appointed Mr. Oseland to look after the
Companies’ interests, and from the list of his duties it would seem
that his office was no sinecure. The Bishop dying in 1840, the lease
fell in, and there were various consultations among the Companies as to
the advisability of a partition or a sale, or the granting of a fresh
lease. The Scriveners alone desired a partition, the others were for
keeping on the late under-lessees and tenants as tenants for a year
until a course could be decided upon, and this was eventually agreed
to, the Barbers recording in their books an expression of their sense
of the wise manner in which the Ironmongers’ Company had managed the
business.

One very important point discussed at Ironmongers’ Hall was that of the
waste and dilapidations which had been suffered to accrue by the late
lessee. These were estimated to amount to £5,000, and there was not
the least question as to the right and power of the Companies to have
enforced a claim in this respect, but they generously decided not even
to present it; had the Companies been “trustees” they would have had no
option but to have enforced their claim.

This action accords with the general liberal administration of Estates
as pursued by the City guilds, and is another evidence (if, indeed,
such evidence were wanting!) of the absence of greed and of the
generous way in which tenants are treated by these bodies.

This Estate is subject to no trust whatever, it was purchased by the
Company out of monies which they collected from individual members of
the Guild, or by the sale of their plate, etc., and for many years it
was unproductive. It is a portion of their private corporate estate,
and no trust or charity suffered by this voluntary abandonment of a
large sum to which they were entitled in lieu of the re-instatement of
the dilapidation. The proceedings are all very fully set out in the
Court Minutes for 1840, 1841, etc.

  6th July, 1609. This daye M{r.} Leacock, M{r.} John Martin, M{r.}
  Thorney & M{r.} Peek accordinge to a pˀcept to the M{rs.} of this
  Company lately directed are by this Courte appoynted Committees
  for this Company to conferre w{th} the rest of the Committees of
  oth{r} Companies concerninge the intended plantac͠on in the Realme
  of Ireland And they are to make theire report to the next Courte of
  their proceedingꝭ therein.

  26th July, 1609. This daie the precept directed from the Lord Maio{r}
  of this Citie to the M{rs} of this Company Concerninge a Contribution
  to be had from this Company towardꝭ the intended plantac͠on in his
  Ma{ties} realme of Ireland was read before the Lyvery of this Company
  and before the Assistantꝭ of the Yeomandry of this Company who being
  by the M{rs} demaunded by vertue of the said precept what they wold
  willingly Contribute towardꝭ the said service some of them proffered
  to Contribute as hereafter ensueth videliz{t} M{r.} Rodes xx{s.}

  rest of the Lyvery and assistauntꝭ of the yeomandrey then present
  refused to Contribute anything at all. Whereupon it was thought fitt
  by this Court that aswell the names of such as had proffered to
  contribute as aforesaid and their severall proffered contribuc͠ons
  also the names of those that refused to contribute shold accordinge
  to the said precept be certefyed in writing to the Lord Maior
  signifyeing further in the same Certificate that forasmuch as the
  Contribuc͠on menc͠oned in the said Certificate was very small w{ch}
  the M{rs} were very unwilling to present to his Lordship, the Company
  were contented if it might stand w{th} his Lo{ps} good pleasure to
  adventure C{li.} of the Cxxiij{li.} w{ch} is owinge unto them by the
  Cities bond, so that they might have a bill of Adventure for the same.

26th January, 1610. The above proposition not having been entertained,
a further precept dated 9th January, 1610, was received, commanding
the Company to furnish £100 and at this Court the same was considered
when it was resolved that the common stock of the Company should
contribute £25 and an assessment be made upon the members as follows:
the Livery 20_s._, the Assistants of the Yeomanry 10_s._, Freemen 6_s._
8_d._, Aliens 20_s._, and foreign brothers 15_s._ each, and by a later
order each member of the Court was assessed at 20_s._

22nd November, 1610. Great difficulty having been experienced in
collecting these assessments, an order was made that any person
neglecting to pay, should be forthwith dismissed out of the Livery or
Court as the case might be.

18th January, 1611. A precept from the Lord Mayor having been read and
debated, the following answer to the same was ordered to be sent--

  Whereas wee the M{r} and Wardens of the Company of the Barbors &
  surgeons of London have receaved a Preceptt of the 14{th} of this
  present moneth from the right honˀable the Lord Mayo{r} of this
  Cittie requiring thereby to call together the Assistauntꝭ of o{r}
  said Company and to consider whether wee will accept a proportion of
  Landꝭ in the province of Ulster in liewe of o{r} moneys disburssed
  and thereon to buyld att our owne chardgꝭ as by the printed book
  of plantac͠on is required or ells to refeir the lettinge of the
  same Landꝭ unto the govˀnor & assistauntꝭ of the Companie: Soe ytt
  is, that accordingly we have called together o{r} Assistauntꝭ &
  consideringe the pˀmisses wee fynd that the payment of the taxac͠ons
  for this intent have been soe burthensome unto the body of o{r}
  Company that we are not able to take upon us any further chardge,
  having not as yet levyed the ffowerth pˀte of the paymˀtꝭ ymposed
  upon us, neither have we any hope to gather the same, And therefore
  rather chuse to refeir the lettinge of the said Landꝭ & committinge
  the business for o{r} pˀtꝭ to the discretion of the said govˀnor
  & assistauntꝭ for that purpose appoynted, hopinge by their good
  endeavo{rs} to receave such reasonable satisfaction for o{r} moneys
  alreadye disbursed as maye gyve good contentment to such of o{r}
  Company whoe have been chardged by o{r} Collections. And this have
  our Court of Assistauntꝭ fully agreed in such mannˀ as wee have
  before certified Given att o{r} Hall this xviij{th} of January 1610
  (_i.e._, 1611).

23rd April, 1611. The Company paid in £30 to the Chamber of London,
making £120 in all to this date.

18th July, 1611. A precept having been received from the Lord Mayor,
calling upon the Wardens to pay £60 more, or else to lose the £120
already paid, the following answer was sent--

  Whereas we the M{rs} & govˀno{rs} of the Company of Barbo{rs} &
  Surgeons of London have receaved from the right honˀable the Lord
  Mayor of this Cittie a preceptt of the xj{th} of this Instant moneth
  thereby comaundinge us to call together the Assistauntꝭ of o{r} said
  Company And then & there to tax the bodye of o{r} s{d} Company with
  the payment of 60{li} more towardꝭ the payment of 10000{li} for a
  new supplye for the plantac͠on in Ireland, And that we should advise
  thereupon and certefie in wrytinge to the govˀno{r} & assistantꝭ for
  the said plantac͠on on Saterdaie the 20{th} of this Instant month
  of July whether we will willinglie yelde to the said supplie of
  10000{li} or we wilbe content to loose all such moneys as we have
  alreadye disburssed towardꝭ the said Plantac͠on and soe passe over
  o{r} right therein to those as will undertake this paym{t} and all
  other taxac͠ons & paymt{s} touchinge the same, Soe yt is we have
  called together o{r} Assistauntꝭ & we thinck that o{r} poore Company
  is put to a very hard choyce seeinge the collection of the formˀ
  paymˀtꝭ of 110{li}[295] have been soe burthensome unto us that the
  greatest nomber of o{r} Company have been readye to growe mutynous
  about the collection thereof neither cane wee as yett gather the
  same (we beinge out of o{r} owne purses for the last paym{t} w{ch}
  was disburssed) and nowe to loose all, except we will undergoe this
  newe taxac͠on of 60{li} the povˀtie of o{r} Company cannot beare ytt
  neither will yt stand w{th} o{r} Credytts to gyve awaie the moneyes
  we have collected from soe maney poore men who hoped (and the rather
  by o{r} pˀswasions) the company should receave in tyme great pˀffytt.
  And they themselves to be pˀtakers thereof to w{ch} intent they dide
  more willinglie undergoe the former taxac͠ons. And againe to drawe
  them to a chardge of a new taxac͠on when they shall understand the
  offer pˀposed in this pˀcept we thinck yt unpossible, neither can we
  tell howe to drawe them to paie any further taxac͠on then they shall
  willinglie consent unto because we have noe lawfull authoritie to
  compell them. Therefore rather then to be any further burthensome
  to the bodye of o{r} Company in any further taxac͠on towardꝭ the
  last supplie of 10000{li} we must be forced (yf there be lawfull
  authoritie to take awaye & compell o{r} Company) to loose the moneys
  we have alreadye disburssed & to leave our Interest unto such as
  wilbe contentede to undertake to dischardge o{r} Company of those
  paymˀtꝭ & taxac͠ons w{ch} we shall be hereafter chardged w{th}all,
  and shall gyve unto our Company such assurance for pˀformaunce of
  such condyc͠ons as we shall agree upon and our Counsell learned
  in the lawes shall devise & requier, whereby we may gyve some
  contentem{t} to those of our Company whoe have been herein chardged
  for we feare we shall never collect these moneyes w{ch} are yet
  behinde & unpaid for the last paym{t} when they shall here the money
  alreadye disburssed is lost & gyven awaie And to this have our Court
  of Assistantꝭ agreed Gyven und{r} o{r} hands the xix{th} of Julye
  1611.

INVENTORIES.


There is amongst the Records a small folio volume which opens with an
undated inventory of the Company’s effects, most probably taken in
1710. Following are inventories spreading over thirty-three years until
1745.

There is much similarity in all of these, and we shall take one of
them, that for the year 1728, as an example.

In 1711 there seem to have been two corporate seals, one of steel and
another of silver; there was also “a mould with the Company’s arms by
w{ch} the Iron Backs were made”; this handsome mould is still preserved
over the chimney-piece in the entrance lobby, and an old “iron back”
cast from it is built into the wall of the courtyard opposite the
entrance door.

PLATE.


The Barber-Surgeons’ Company has at various periods in its history
possessed large quantities of plate, a great deal of which is now
unfortunately lost to us, most of it having been parted with during the
troublous times of the seventeenth century, when the money demands made
upon the Company necessitated its sale. We have however, been fortunate
in preserving some very distinctive and beautiful plate, among which
are no less than three Royal gifts from Sovereigns of England, viz.,
Henry VIII, Charles II, and Anne.

Throughout our Minutes are numerous references to gifts and purchases

Coll: Cambridge and free of the Company, gave a large round silver salt
white with three scrolls, and with his arms and an inscription engraved
thereon.

1636. The Company having spent large sums of money in the erection of
the Theatre, and being short of cash, an order was made to sell the
whole of the Yeomanry’s Plate, excepting a beer bowl the gift of Mr.
James Kent.

1637. It having come to the knowledge of the Court that Mr. Alexander
Baker (Master 1622) had bequeathed to the Company a cup and cover which
was withheld by his executors, a suit was commenced against them.

  19th May, 1637. This daye was presented to this Court by a suite &
  decree made in his Ma{t}ꝭ Court of Requestꝭ one standing Cupp and
  Cover gilt of M{r} Alexander Bakers gift weighing 131 ounces.

  Court confirmed & ordered y{t} that money received shall be imployed
  towardꝭ the buildingꝭ now in hand.

  31st October, 1642. Whereas heretofore by Order of the Lords &
  Com̃ons in Parliament assembled Our Company was proporc͠oned to pay
  and lend 800{li} at 8{li} pˀ cent towards and for nothing else than
  the releife of Ireland. Upon which our Company did humbly certifie
  the Lord Maior of the Citty of our inability to pay any part of the
  said 800{li} Yet for that the present occasions forceing for presente
  Releife It was Ordered That 400{li} should be taken up at Interest
  and payd over into the Chamber of London for that and noe other
  purpose. And that now the Company would take up such a quantity of
  money but cannott obteyne soe much, It is now ordered That the Kings
  Cupp and Cover shalbe kept, And that the Ma{s} & Wardens shall take
  out all our plate and view it and see which of it is fitt to be sold
  and that every parcell of that plate which shalbe sold a patterne
  or fashion of it shalbe drawne in paper and the perticuler Letters
  Writeings or Graveings shall likewise be written on that paper. To
  the intent that when the said ffoure Hundred Pounds with the Interest
  at 8{li} p. centum shalbe repayd the said Plate shalbe made againe in
  the same ffashions & writeings upon them as now they are which this
  Court doth order shall fully and really be performed accordingly when
  the said 400{li} and Interest shalbe repayd.

The following entry is curious from the fact of a blank having been no
doubt purposely left in the Minutes. The Company, who had been already
plucked by the Parliament, evidently feared violence in that quarter,
but were afraid to put it on record, and therefore very prudently left
a hiatus in the Minutes.

  24th May, 1643. Whereas this Company is assessed at 8{li} pˀ weeke
  for 3 moneths which they are noe wayes able to pay In regard wee are
  soe much in debt and that the Hall may be preserved from violence
  of . . . . . . . It is now Ordered That the plate in the Hall that is
  not guilt plate shalbe by the M{r} and Wardens delivered over at the
  best rate to deliver soe much amounting to 96{li.}

By the Wardens’ Accounts it appears that plate was sold to the extent
of £94 16_s._ 0_d._

29th April, 1645. On reference to p. 140, it will be seen that no less
than 1,120 oz. of plate was pawned to M{rs} Crosse.

  29th April, 1646. The M{r} & Wardens acquainting this Court That the
  Companye’s plate is redeemed from M{r} Steele at his request who
  married M{rs} Crosse to whome it was formerly pawned in her Widowhood
  and is now in the Treasury. This Court doth think it not convenient
  to be kept in the house[311] and doth order that it be delivered into
  the hands of M{r} John Browne[312] for the better secureity of the
  200{li} this Company oweth him and of the 100{li} more which he hath
  promised by M{r} Warden Browne to lend the Company at vj{li} pˀ ceñtn
  pˀ anñ.

  [311] Probably in fear of its being forcibly seized.
  [312] An Assistant.

14th May, 1646. The plate was pawned to Mr. John Browne for £300 at 6
per cent.

29th April, 1647. It was ordered that it should be redeemed, and it was
on the 17th May following all brought back to the Hall.

7th December, 1648. The plate was again pawned to Mr. John Browne, of
Westminster, for £250.

19th March, 1649. The Court were so severely pressed by Assessments for
the Army, and being unable to borrow any more money under the Company’s
seal, resolved after much deliberation to absolutely sell Plate to the
value of £300.

19TH JULY, 1649. OUR M{R} ACQUAINTED THIS COURT THAT UPON SALE OF THE
COMPANYES PLATE M{R} EDWARD ARRIS BOUGHT KING HENRY THE EIGHTHS CUP AND
COVER AND HATH FREELY GIVEN IT AGAINE TO THIS COMPANY.

1890. The following plate is now in the Company’s possession:

A handsome standing silver gilt Grace cup and Cover (26-1/2 ozs.)
presented by King Henry VIII in 1540 in commemoration of the union
of the Barbers with the Surgeons. This cup is elaborately chased and
enriched with badges of the Tudor Rose, Portcullis, and Fleur-de-lys;
the cover is surmounted with the Crown Imperial under which are the
arms of France and England quarterly, with the lyon and greyhound
as supporters. There are four bells pendant from the cup which are
referred to by Pepys as follows:--

  Among other observables at Chyrurgeon’s Hall we drunk the King’s
  health out of a gilt cup, given by King Henry viij., to the Company,
  with bells hanging at it, which every man is to ring by shaking after
  he hath drunk up the whole cup.--_Diary, 27th February, 1662-3._

[Illustration: GRACE CUP. H. viij.]

This cup although it has been stolen, pawned and sold, yet remains to
us, one of the most precious relics of our past. It appears by the
Wardens’ Accounts, that in 1669 John Knight, Serjeant-Surgeon, who was
Master, had the cup repaired and a case made for it; Serjeant Knight
was again Master 1677-8, when he caused a plate to be fixed within the
cover with this inscription--

  Henrici R. Munificentia Ne Posteris Ignota Maneat Johannis Knight
  R.C.P.[313] 1678.

  [313] Regis Chir. Principalis (Chief Surgeon to the King).

In the bowl of the Cup is an outline engraving of the old coat of the
Barbers, impaling the cognizance of the Surgeons in one shield (_see_
p. 435).

King Charles II in 1676 presented us with a very handsome and unique
parcel gilt standing cup and cover, surmounted by the crown imperial,
and having within the same the Royal arms, supporters and crown (68
ozs.). This Cup is known as “The Royal Oak Cup” (commemorative of
the King’s escape at Boscobel), its stem and base representing the
trunk and roots of an oak tree; the bowl or upper part is surrounded
with oak leaves, branches, wreaths of flowers, escallop shells, and
pendant acorns as bells from shields. The Company’s arms are engraved
on one shield, on another the crest, on the third is the following
inscription:--“Donum Munificentissimi Regis Caroli Secundi Anno 1676,”
and on the last shield--“Impetrantibus Chirurgis Regiis Johanne Knight
Chirurgo Regis Principali et Jacobo Pearse Eodem Anno Societatis
Magistro.”

[Illustration: KING CHARLES’ CUP, QUEEN ANNE’S PUNCH BOWL AND
ATKINSON’S PUNCH LADLES.]

This James Pearse, surgeon to the King and the Duke of York, was Master
in 1675, and his wife will be well remembered as one of Samuel Pepys’
friends and gossips.

Queen Anne in 1704 presented the Company with a fine and massive punch
bowl (160 ozs.) bearing this inscription:--

  Societati Chirurgorum Londin: Ob fidem et diligentiam In examinandis
  Chirurgis In Classe Regia merituris Dono dedit Serenissima Regina
  ANNA Principum Optima 1704: Impetravit Carolus Bernardus Arm. Chir.
  Reg. Pr. Hujus Societatis Magister.

Four large loving cups and covers. These are all of similar design
though of different sizes, the covers have each a handle formed as
an effigy of a Roman soldier, and each cup bears the Company’s arms
engraved thereon.

1st. Martin Browne’s cup (45 ozs.). He was an eminent Surgeon and
Master in 1653; on one side is engraved a shield quarterly, 1st and
4th three Estoilles, 2nd and 3rd three Escallops and a Horn, “Charisma
Martini Browne Armigeri Nuper Senatoris Ciuitatis Londinensis &
Præfecti Societatis Barbitonsõr & Chirurgõr 1653.”

2nd. Thomas Bowden’s cup (38 ozs.). He was third Warden 1654. On
one side is engraved a shield quarterly, with a lyon passant on the
first quarter only. The motto of the Company is misspelt thus, “de
Pricipiencia dei,” and the cup bears this inscription, “Ex dono Thomæ
Bowdeni Chirurgi et hujus Societatis Gubernatorum quarti Anno Dni.
1654.”

3rd. Sir John Frederick’s cup (38 ozs. 10 dwt.). He was Master 1654 and
1658, and Lord Mayor 1662. This cup is engraved with Sir John’s shield,
on a chief three doves, and the Company’s motto is again misspelt.
The inscription is, “The guift of John Fredricke Alderman and of This
Societie Master Anno Dñi 1654.”

4th. Thomas Bell’s cup (65 ozs.). On one side is engraved Mr. Bell’s
Coat of arms, on a chief three Bells, and there is this inscription,
“The Gift of Thomas Bell Chirurgion to y{e} Worshipfull Company of
Barbor Chirurgions London July 28{th} 1663.”

Four silver goblets or wine cups (33 oz.). Each is inscribed--

martlets and a crescent for difference all within a bordure ermine;
on the other side are the Company’s arms with the motto misspelt. The
inscription is--

  Thomas Collins Artis Chirurgicæ Professor Peritissimus, ut Symbolum
  Amoris venerabili Chirurgorum Societate hoc donauit.

Five covered tankards, the first three having the Company’s arms
engraved thereon.

1st. Perrott’s tankard (23 oz.). “The guift of Abraham Perrott.” He was
admitted to the freedom 5th July, 1614, and gave the tankard in March,
1640. (_See head piece p. 492._)

2nd. Gray’s tankard (37 oz. 2 dwt.). “Ex dono Georgij Gray,” no date.

a typical example. (_See head piece p. 492._)

(circa 1730); these are also illustrated by Mr. Cripps.

PICTURES.


The following are some extracts from the Minutes, relating to Pictures.

  24th June, 1601. It is this daye by consent of a wholl Courte
  of Assistance ordered That if at any tyme hereafter any M{r} or
  Governor of this company or any oth{r} pˀsone or pˀsones free of the
  same mistery shall blott deface or put oute or cause to be blotted
  defaced or put oute any of the pictures of any of this Company nowe
  paynted or hereafter lawfully placed in any of the tables of pictures
  hangeinge in the Com̃on hall of this mistery w{th}out the Consent of
  a full Courte of Assistance That then hee or they so offendinge shall
  forfeyte and paye for every such offence x{li} the one half thereof
  to be to the use of the Chamberlen of the Cytie of London And the
  oth{r} half to the use of the said mistery.

The above order was made in consequence of some members of the Court
having painted out the faces on the pictures, and caused their own to
be depicted in their stead.

  28th June, 1604. This daye it is ordered that M{r} Will{m} Martin
  M{r} ffrederick M{r} ffyneinge & M{r} ffenton shall pˀsently conferre
  with Decreete concerninge the ffynisheinge of the tables of Picktures
  remayneinge w{th} him and if hee will finishe the same w{th} reason
  and drawe them to the Hall they are to compound w{th} him for the
  same if not the table is to be taken awaye from him.

  10th October, 1605. This day it is ordered that the Kingꝭ picture
  shalbe by the said pˀnte M{rs} boughte and pˀvided at the charge of
  this house.

  Item paid for his Ma{t}ꝭ picture              iiij{li}
  Item geven to the paynters man that
    broughte the said pycture                             ii{s}   vj{d}

  1st August, 1634. It is ordered that the 41 philosophers pictures
  shalbe rebeautified and repaired by M{r} Greeneburye at the Costs of
  this house soe it exceede not x{li.}

The “forty-one philosophers” were former Masters of Anatomy and
Examiners of Surgeons, who as they were from time to time appointed,
might if they chose, have their portraits put in what was called “The
Table of the Anatomy” (and which was, I think, one large picture
containing the effigies of forty-one persons), and the practice
undoubtedly was, as occasion arose, to paint a face on old shoulders;
indeed, there are many notices to this effect, as also orders of Court
for blotting out the “faces” of such as had become obnoxious, or who
had been removed for misconduct.

  1st February, 1627. Item this daye upon the moc͠on of our M{r} it is
  ordered by this Court that there shalbe a large wainscott frame made
  and a picture maker shalbe agreed withall by the present M{rs} for
  the portreying of the Anathomye and makeing of M{r} Docto{r} Gwins
  picture and the Clarkes which Charge shalbe borne out of the stock
  of this house, in which table shalbe placed the figures & visages of
  every of the Assistants whoe are not painted in the Anathomye table
  that now standeth upp in the Hall, every of the Assistants payeing
  for the setting up of his owne picture.

  29th March, 1647. This Court doth order That M{r} Henry Watsons
  ffigure in the present Table of Anatomy be blotted out and M{r}
  Charleyes Effigies placed in the roome thereof Provided that his
  Executrix pay his Legacy to this House.

  This Court doth order That there be a new Anathomy Table And that
  all the Assistants whose Effigies are not in the present Table may
  be sett up in the new Table at theire owne charge, and that Doctor
  Goddards ffigure be there sett as Reader and Doctor Prudions Effigies
  may be painted there if he desireth it And this Court doth order that
  M{r} Watson a Brother of this Company shall make the said Table and
  paint thereon the ffigure of an Anathomy with the severall ffigures
  of the said Reader Doctor Prudion and our Clarke at the charge of
  this House And that the ffigures of the present M{rs} of Anatomy be
  there sett as Dissectors at theire owne charge.

  9th August, 1647. This Court takeing into considerac͠oon the greate
  benefitt and proffitt That have accrewed to this House by M{r} Edward
  Arris a loveing Brother of this Company This Court doth order That
  his picture be sett up in the Blanck Table in the Hall next the
  Anathomy Table at the charge of this Howse.

  19th August, 1647. Upon the earnest request of Mr. Edward Arris to
  this Court That his Picture be nott sett up in the Hall according to
  the Order of the last Court of Assistants This Court to satisfy Mr.
  Arris modest request therein doth order that that order be annulled
  and not put in execuc͠on.

Notwithstanding this order Mr. Arris’ portrait was painted, and is
still at the Hall.

  27th February, 1650. M{r} Arris and Doctor Scarboroughs pictures to
  be sett in the void Table in the Hall at the charge of this House.

In 1720 the Court were possibly thinking of purchasing another Holbein,
as the following note occurs in the minutes,

  3rd March, 1720. Memorand{m} M{r} Lenthall at Burford in Oxfordshire
  has a Picture of S{r} Thomas More and his familey drawn by Hans
  Holben being a dispute between his Protestant Daughter and his
  Catholick Daughter in the pˀsence of the father and the rest of the
  familey.

  21st April, 1720. It is referred to the Governors to treat with M{r}
  Vertue the Ingraver about Ingraving King Henry the Eighths Picture
  and to report his proposall to a Court of Assistants.

27th August, 1734. The question of engraving the Picture was again
referred to a Committee.

17th September, 1734. The Committee reported, the result being that Mr.
Bernard Baron entered into an agreement to engrave a plate; the details
of the arrangements with him are all set out in the minutes, but are
not sufficiently interesting to warrant transcribing.

Baron’s engraving is well known and sought after by collectors, but it
has a peculiarity, being a complete reverse of the original picture.
Each Assistant is presented with a copy on his election on to the Court.

We formerly had a portrait of Dr. Tyson, Anatomy Reader, but this was
sold to one of his descendants in 1745 for ten guineas.

10th November, 1777. Mr. William Slade, an Assistant, presented a
mezzotint engraving of the portrait of John Paterson, Esq., formerly

                                         GUILDHALL, 31 October, 1832.
    GENTLEMEN,

  Having become possessed a few years since of a perfect copy of
  Hollar’s engraved view of London A.D. 1647, representing the most
  striking appearance of the metropolis as it existed previously to
  the conflagration in 1666, and thinking it might be acceptable to
  the Lovers of the Antiquities of this ancient and renowned City that
  so authentic a Memorial of its then state should be preserved and
  transmitted to future ages by Multiplication of Copies.

  I have had it carefully and correctly Lithographed, and request
  that your Worshipful Court will be pleased to accept the impression
  herewith transmitted to be placed in the Archives of the Company of
  Barbers.

               I have the honor to be, GENTLEMEN,
                          Your most obed{t.} Servant,
                                              W. L. NEWMAN,
                                                  _City Solicitor_.

  To the Master Wardens and    }
  Assistants of the Worshipful }
  Company of Barbers, London.  }

This picture is now hung up in the corridor.

The following is but little more than a List of the Pictures now at
Barbers’ Hall, a full account of which has been already written by Mr.
C. J. Shoppee.

ALDERMAN ARRIS’ PICTURE. This picture was painted by Mr. Greenbury who
was employed as Portrait Painter to the Company at this period.

DR. CHARLES SCARBOROUGH AND ALDERMAN ARRIS’ PICTURE. This picture was
also painted by Mr. Greenbury as by the following extract from the
Wardens’ Accounts for 1651 appears--

  Paid to Greenburye for Painting the Picture of     _li._ _s._ _d._
    M{r} Edward Arris and Doctor Charles
    Scarborough & Anathomye                             9   10    0

LINNEUS’ PICTURE. This picture of Linneus was purchased 2nd July, 1844,
for £3 3_s._, the particulars of the purchase and of the picture are
set out in the Court Minutes of this date. Mr. Shoppee has surmised
that this is a portrait of John Bancks, but though his portrait was
_ordered_ to be painted, I do not find that it ever was, and it is not
once mentioned in any of the numerous early inventories of pictures.
The Minutes of 1844 are, however, so precise as to leave no further
doubt on this point, viz., that it is a portrait of Linneus.

THE HOLBEIN PICTURE.

KING CHARLES II PICTURE, artist unknown. Purchased by the Company
1720-1721.

INIGO JONES’ PICTURE, by Sir A. Vandyke.

THOMAS LISLE’S PICTURE, artist unknown.

SIR JOHN FREDERICK’S PICTURE, artist unknown. Purchased by the Company,
1665-1666.

SERJEANT-SURGEON CHARLES BERNARD’S PICTURE. This picture was painted by
Mr. Murray in 1711, the Company paying him £12 10_s._ for it.

THE DUCHESS OF RICHMOND’S PICTURE, by Sir Peter Lely.

HENRY JOHNSON’S PICTURE, artist unknown. Mr. Johnson was Master 1677;
he has been erroneously described as “Serjeant Surgeon” and “Serjeant
Knight,” but never held the first office, and there is no such dignity
as “Serjeant Knight.” The fact is that Mr. Johnson dying in his year of
Master, was succeeded by John Knight, Serjeant Surgeon (commonly called
“Serjeant Knight”) and Mr. Knight’s name being so written under Mr.
Johnson’s in an old list of Masters, has been taken as the title of an
office!

EPHRAIM SKINNER’S PICTURE, artist unknown.

BERNARD BARON’S red crayon study of Holbein’s picture.

“TWO SPANISH PICTURES.” These were so called in the old Inventories.
There was also in the Inventory of 1720 “A picture of the Prince
Elector Palatine,” but this subsequently disappeared, though the
“Spanish pictures” remained in the Inventories for many years. Mr.
Shoppee suggests that they are the portraits of Frederick Casimir and
his wife Elizabeth. At the top of one of them is a shield of arms,
being the coat of Byrkes or Brykes.

QUEEN ANNE’S PICTURE, artist unknown.

All the foregoing Pictures are hung in the Court Room. In the Committee
Room are various pictures, engravings and portraits of recent Masters.

In the Vestibule to the Court Room is an ancient list of Masters and
Wardens on Vellum, enclosed with oak folding doors. It is not, however,
very accurate. It was at the Hall in 1720, and probably for many years
previously. The list was rewritten over the old lettering in 1865.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES OF EMINENT MEMBERS.


HENRY NEVILL, FOURTH LORD OF BURGAVENNY.

This Lord was the son of Sir George Nevill, third Lord of Burgavenny,
by Mary, daughter of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham.

He succeeded his father in 1535, and was admitted to the freedom of the
Barber-Surgeons on the 26th August, 1584. In 1586 he was one of the
Commissioners appointed to try Mary Queen of Scots.

For striking the Earl of Oxford in the Chamber of Presence, he was put
under arrest, but managed shortly after to obtain a pardon and his
freedom.

He married Frances, daughter of Thomas Earl of Rutland, by whom he left
at his decease, 10th February, 1557, an only daughter Elizabeth (the
wife of Sir Thomas Fane), who was subsequently created Baroness le
Despencer.


LORD WINDSOR.

  25th June, 1631. This daie o{r} M{r} signifieing to the Court the
  affectionatenes of the right hono{ble} the Lord Thomas Windsor Knight
  of the noble order of the bath and Barron Windsor of Bradenham, w{ch}
  this Court Loveingly and gratefullie embraceing doe graunt his Lo{ps}
  request and thereupon the said Lord was here in Court admitted and
  sworne free brother of this Corporac͠on. Alsoe the said Thomas Lord
  Windsor was by o{r} M{r} received into the Clothing or livery of this
  Companie and had a livery hood layed upon his lo{ps} shoulder.

Lord Windsor at one time resided in Monkwell Street, close to the Hall;
he was chosen a Knight of the Bath 1610, at the creation of Henry,
Prince of Wales. He was subsequently Rear-Admiral of the Fleet sent
by James I to bring Prince Charles out of Spain, and on that occasion
entertained on board ship the Grandees of the Court of Spain with
princely magnificence. His Lordship married Lady Katherine Somerset
daughter of Edward, fourth Earl of Worcester, K.G., but dying without
issue on the 6th June, 1642, he was succeeded by his nephew Thomas
Windsor-Hickman, the son of his elder sister Elizabeth.


THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH, K.G.

James Scott, the natural son of Charles II, was born 9th April, 1649,
and created Duke of Monmouth in 1663. The same year, on the 7th May,
he was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons, in company with
Alexander Lord Leven, Richard Hopton, and Thomas Rosse, Esquires.

The history of this unfortunate man is well known, and culminated in
his being beheaded on the 15th July, 1685.


ALEXANDER, SECOND EARL OF LEVEN.

This nobleman was the grandson of the celebrated General Sir Alexander
Leslie, First Earl of Leven, whom he succeeded in 1662. On the 7th May,
1663, he was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons, in company
with the Duke of Monmouth.

He married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Howard, and sister of the
Earl of Carlisle, but died without issue male, in 1663. His kinsman
George, fourth Lord Melville, was a staunch adherent of the Duke of
Monmouth, and involved in the rebellion, but was lucky enough to escape
into Holland; he was, however, attainted and his estates forfeited
in 1685, but coming back to England with William III his estates and
dignity were restored to him.


SIR JOHN AYLEF.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

SIR JOHN AYLEF was an eminent Surgeon and probably born about 1490.
Diligent search has been made for his parentage, but without success.
In his will he refers to seven “poor” people “being of my kynn dwelling
in Grenewiche,” and from the fact that he had a grant of arms instead
of inheriting a paternal coat, as also the silence of his immediate
descendants when registering the pedigrees at the Heralds’ Visitations
(who must have known but did not care to register Sir John’s father),
it may be assumed that he was of humble origin.

[Illustration: Family tree - handwritten]

He was admitted to the freedom of the Barbers prior to 1522 and served
the office of Warden 1530, 1532 and 1535, being chosen Master 1538.
At this time he was Surgeon to Henry VIII and had cured him of a
fistula, for which the king granted him the manor of Gryttenham in
Wiltshire, part of the lands of the Abbey of Malmesbury. Henry also
bequeathed by his will 100 marks to Aylef.

Mr. Aylef, being elected on 1st August, 1548, served the office of
Sheriff 1548-9, and in Wriothesley’s Chronicle under date 1549 we read--

  The third daie of March being Shrove Sondaie M{r} Henry Amcottes Lord
  Maior of London was presented to the Kinges Maiestie at his pallace
  at Westminster. And after the oration made by M{r} Recorder to his
  Maiestie and aunswere again by my Lord Chauncelor unto the maior
  and aldermen, the Kinges Maiestie made my Lord Maior, Knight, and
  M{r} William Locke, Alderman, and M{r} John Ayliffe, barbar surgeon,
  sheriffes of London for this yeare, were made knightes also in the
  Chambre of Presens, the Kinges Maiestie standing under his cloath of
  estate.

[Illustration: SIR JOHN AYLEF

_From the original painting by_ HOLBEIN, AT BARBER’S HALL.]

Two days afterwards Sir John had a grant of arms from Sir Thomas
Hawley, Clarencieux, and shortly after was elected Alderman of Dowgate
Ward. He seems to have relinquished his profession of a Surgeon and
to have become a Merchant, holding the important office of Master of
Blackwell Hall, one of the greatest commercial centres of the period,
and residing at the Hall, in the parish of St. Michael Bassishaw.

On the 28th May, 1550, he was chosen the first Alderman of the
newly-created ward of Bridge Without, some interesting particulars
of which may be seen in Stow’s Survey (ed. 1633, p. 446); while in
Wriothesley’s Chronicle, under date 1550, we also read--

  Memorandum. Wednesday in the Whitson weeke, at a Court of the
  Aldermen kept in the Guyldhall, Sir John Aliffe, Knight, and master
  of Blackwell Hall, was sworne an alderman of the Bridg ward without,
  and to have the jurisdiction of the Borough of Southwark, and 2
  deputies to be appointed there to assist him, which was the first
  alderman that ever was there, which was done by the advise of my Lord
  Mayor and thˀ Aldermen, for the better order to be kept there, and
  for the more quietnes of the Mayors hereafter to come, and the good
  order of the Kinges subjectes there, accordinge to the lawes of the
  City; and the Fryday after he rode with my Lord Mayor all the precint
  of Southwarke, my Lord Mayor havinge a certeine nomber of the honest
  persons of the borough at the bridg-house, to whom he shewed theyr
  alderman, and appointed deputies under him, and so hereafter to see a
  good order to be kept in the Borough, as in other wardes of the citye
  of London.

Sir John subsequently removed to his old ward of Dowgate (and continued
Alderman there till his death, his successor being chosen 12th
November, 1556). After his election as Alderman he was translated to
the Grocers’ Company, of which ancient guild he was crowned Upper
Warden, 9th June, 1556, in view of his election as Lord Mayor for
which he stood next in nomination, and to which office, had he lived
but a few weeks longer, he would in all probability have been chosen.
He was married to Isabel Buckell of Warwickshire, and by her had four
children, John, Erkynwald, Mary and Alice. His son John and great
grandson George, were both knighted. His widow, Dame Isabel, had a
grant of arms by Thomas Hawley (3 & 4 Ph. & M.) ar. a fesse vaire or
and az. betw. three doves ppr. bearing in their beaks a branch gu. Sir
John Aylef’s funeral is thus recorded in Machyn’s Diary, 1556--

  The xx of October was bered ser John Olyff knyght and altherman,
  and sum-tym he was surgantt[314] unto kyng Henry the viij{th}, and

Sir John Aylef’s will, dated 26th September, 1556, was proved 24th
December, 1556. He was, he says,

Isabel and their heirs the manor of “Greteman” (Gryttenham), Wilts, and
that he was seised in fee of the parsonage of Wakeringe (near Rochford,
Essex), and of a marsh called Alforde Nash, in the parish of Estwood

[318] Sheriff, 1554.

Sir John Aylef’s name has been spelt in many ways, Aylif, Ailiff, Alif,
Olyff, Ailyffe, etc.; in his will it is spelt Aliff. But this family
must not be confounded with that of John Oliphe, Alderman and Sheriff
1569, buried at St. Laurence Pountney, 4th July, 1577; although Wilson,
in his History of that parish, at p. 232, mistakes John the son of that
Alderman for John the son of our Alderman.

For some notices of the Aylefs _see_ Aubrey’s collections for Wilts,
and Marshall’s Visitation of Wilts.

The pedigree is compiled principally from Harl. MSS. 897, 1165 and
1443.


THOMAS VICARY,[319] SERJEANT-SURGEON.

[Illustration: THOMAS VICARY.

_From the original painting by_ HOLBEIN, AT BARBER’S HALL.]

Thomas Vicary was probably born between 1490 and 1500, and is stated
in Manningham’s Diary to have been “at first a meane practiser in
Maidstone untill the King advanced him for curing his sore legge.”
In 1525 he was third Warden of the Barbers’ Company, and in 1528
Upper Warden and one of the Surgeons of Henry VIII with £20 a year.
In 1530 he was Master of the Company and appointed Serjeant-Surgeon,
which latter office he held until his death. In 1539 Henry granted
him a beneficial lease for 21 years of the Rectory and tithes of the
dissolved Abbey of Boxley in Kent. In 1541 Vicary was chosen Master
of the Barber-Surgeons, to which office he was again elected in 1546,
1548, and 1557 having thus held the chief place in the Company no
less than five times--an honour to which no other member has ever
attained. In the Holbein picture Vicary is represented as receiving the
Charter from the King. In 1542 he and his son William were appointed
by the King Bailiffs of the Manor of Boxley, and five years later he
married his second wife, Alice Bucke. In 1548 Vicary was appointed a
Governor of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and soon afterwards became the
Resident Surgical Governor there; in June, 1552, he was made “one of
the assistants of this house (St. Bartholomew’s) for the terme of his
lyffe.” In 1548 he published his celebrated book “The Anatomie of the
bodie of man,” no copy of the first edition of which is now known to
be extant. On the 27th January, 1561, Vicary made his will, which was
proved in London 7th April, 1562. The will, which is set out in full in
Dr. Furnivall’s book, is too long to give here _in extenso_, but the
following extracts will be found of interest.

[319] This notice of Vicary is partially condensed from the exhaustive
account of him, written by Dr. F. J. Furnivall, and published in the
Early English Text Society. Extra series LIII.

his widow Alice.


RICHARD FERRIS, SERJEANT-SURGEON.

But little is known of Richard Ferris, though he was doubtless a
man of repute, as Gale speaks approvingly of him, and he held the
office of Serjeant-Surgeon in Queen Elizabeth’s time; his portrait is
preserved by Holbein in our great picture, and Henry VIII, by his will,
bequeathed him 100 marks. He was twice Master of the Barber-Surgeons,
viz., in 1551 and 1562.

His will, dated 17th March, 1566, was proved on the 22nd April, 1566,
wherein he describes himself as “Richard Ferres Serjant Surgion unto
the quenes majestie, sick of bodie.” He gives to “Em,” his wife, his
house, field, and orchard at Paddington for her life, with remainder
to his daughter Thomazine, and to her also the lease of the house
where he then dwelt in St. Giles, Cripplegate. In the event of their
deaths without issue, the property to be sold and distributed amongst
the poor in the discretion of his overseer, John Field[330] and Dr.
Gregorie Wisdom, except 40_s._ to his cousin Johanne Sympson. To his

JOHN PEN.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

Much time has been spent in the endeavour to ascertain John Pen’s
parentage, but without success. Among the Domestic State Papers, Henry
VIII, Vol. I (No. 4064) is the grant of a corrody or sustentation from
the Monastery of Abbotsbury to Robert Pen “one of the Gentlemen of the
Chapel” and to John Pen, his son, for life. The date of this document
is 9th March, 1514, and as John Pen was a retainer of the King’s,
which this grant would also seem to imply, and had a son whom he named
Robert, there is the possibility that this Robert Pen, the Gentleman of
the Chapel, was his father.

John Pen was admitted to the freedom of the Barbers in 1527, and his
birth may probably be put at 1500-1505. He was by profession a barber,
and evidently a friend of King Henry VIII, who advanced him from Groom
of the Privy Chamber to the honorable position of King’s Barber, an
office which was only bestowed upon the most trusty and confidential of
the King’s attendants; the life of the sovereign being in his barber’s
hands. (_See_ pp. 90 and 91.)

Pen served the office of Master in 1539, and his portrait is in the
Holbein picture. He married, about 1530, Lucy, daughter and heiress
of Edmond Chevall of Sissivernes, in Codicote, Herts, and by her he
had a good estate. In 1545 Henry granted him the manor of Codicote and
the demesne lands of the late dissolved Abbey of St. Alban’s for £826
9_s._ 4-1/2_d._, to hold by the forty-fifth part of a knight’s fee.
The King also bequeathed him 100 marks by his will. By an Inquisition
taken at West Barnet 18th October, 5 & 6 Ph. & M., it was found that
John Pen died 21st August, 1558, and that Thomas, his son and heir, was
then of the age of 25 years and 9 months. John Pen’s Will, dated 15th
August, 1558, was proved by his widow on the 6th May, 1559. Coleman
in his list of Wills of the Pen family states that a second grant of
Probate was taken of this Will by Gyles Pen on 10th October, 1560, but
this is absolutely incorrect; on this date the Will of one Gyles Peny
of Halstocke in Dorsetshire was proved, and Mr. Coleman has confounded
this in a remarkable way with John Pen’s Will, with which it has no
connection whatever. That Pen was not, or did not know that he was,
a connection of the Pens of Bucks, is most likely, as he obtained a
grant of arms for himself, in which the combs on either side of the
lion of England are typical of his office of King’s Barber. These arms
were 1{st} & 4{th} Ar. on a fesse gu. betw. three peacocks az. a lyon
pass. guar. or betw. two combs of the first (Pen) 2{d} & 3{rd} Or three
horses’ heads couped sa. bridled ar. (Cheval).

The following is the text of his will:--

NICHOLAS ALCOCKE.

He was admitted to the freedom in 1523, and was Surgeon to Edward VI;
his portrait is in the Holbein picture. He died in the early part of
1550, and his will dated 15th February, 1549-50, was proved 6th May,
1550. In it he describes himself as “One of the Surgions to the Kingꝭ
Ma{tie}” and directs that his body shall be buried in the Church of
St. Stephen, Coleman Street, near where his children are buried. He

ROBERT BALTHROP, SERJEANT-SURGEON.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

ROBERT BALTHROP was born in 1522, and about the year 1538 apprenticed
to Nicholas Alcock (Surgeon to King Edward VI). He was admitted to
the freedom 3rd March, 1545, and to the Livery 20th October, 1552. He
served the office of Warden in 1560 and 1564, and was Master of the
Company in 1565 and again in 1573. About the year 1562 he was appointed
Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen Elizabeth and held that office until his
death (9th December, 1591).

He is buried in the church of St. Bartholomew the Less, where there is
(behind the organ) on the south wall of the church, a handsome monument
to his memory with this inscription--

  Here Robert Balthrope lyes intombd, to Elizabeth our Queene,
  Who Sergeant of the Surgeons sworne neere thrtye yeeres hathe
    beene.
  He died at syxtie nine of yeeres December’s ninthe the daye

    from grounde.
             VIVIT      POST     FUNERA      VIRTUS.

Balthrop’s will was made about a fortnight before his death (27th
November), and therein he directs his body to be buried in St.
Bartholomew’s the Less, in which parish he then resided. He seems to
have amassed a considerable estate and to have made a rather lengthy
will, but as a great deal of it is of much interest, especially his
inventory of surgical instruments and books, no apology is needed for
quoting largely from it.

  I do give and bequeathe my sowle to the holy and blessed Trinitie
  the ffather the sonne and the holy ghost three persons and one
  God allmightie hoping and stedfastly beleevinge to be forgiven

SIR PETER PROBY.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

PETER PROBY was born at Chester, and was the son of Randolph Proby,
afterwards of Brampton, Hunts, by his wife, a Miss Bernard. He was
admitted to our freedom in 1579, made a Liveryman 1st July, 1596, an
Assistant 6th July, 1609, and served the office of Master 1615. He was
Sheriff of London 1614, Alderman of the Ward of Queenhithe, and Lord
Mayor in 1622.

[Illustration: Family tree]

  to come to the hall he is to be kindlie and freindlie intertayned.
  finis coronabit opus.

24th May, 1614. It was agreed that Mr. Alderman Proby should, if he
desired it, “have the use of this house together with the plate and
other necessaries for to keep his Shrievalty,” and if he desired to
keep his Shrievalty elsewhere he was to be allowed to borrow the plate
for a year; and on the 1st July it was agreed that £40 should be given
to him towards the “bewtifying of his howse.”

25th August, 1614. Fifteen Members of the Court of Assistants were
nominated to attend Mr. Sheriff Proby on Michaelmas eve and the next
day, and all charges and expenses which they might incur were to be
borne by the Company.

In 1616, Sir Peter who had previously been appointed Governor of the
colony of Ulster by special commission from the King and the City
of London, repaired thither, attended by divers of the most eminent
citizens, to regulate certain affairs belonging to the plantation,
taking with him two rich swords of state as a present from the City, to
be carried before the Mayors of Londonderry and Coleraine, the former
having been some time before erected into a city and the latter into a
Mayor-town.

8th June, 1622. At a Court held this day Alderman Proby was ordered to
be translated to the Grocers’ Company, in view of his coming election

  At this Court it is agreed that M{r} Alderman Probie shall have our

Sir Peter’s eldest son, Heneage, was knighted; he was Sheriff of Bucks,
and M.P. for Amersham. His second son, Henry, was Common Serjeant of
London. Sir Peter was the ancestor of several members of Parliament
as also of the Marquess of Rockingham and the Earl of Carysfort. His
grandson Peter Proby, who married Grace, daughter of Sir Richard Ford,
was chosen a Liveryman of the Company 10th March, 1659.

Sir Peter Proby’s will (undated) was proved 21st March, 1625, and
commences--

  I Peter Proby Knight and Alderman of London calling to minde the
  transitory estate of all flesh and more perticulerly the great age

  infirmities w{ch} still hanging one mee as be many monito{rs} unto
  me to pˀvide for my approachinge change and settlinge of that poore
  state wherew{th} it hath pleased god to blesse mee.

He gives to his wife Dame Elizabeth Proby (of whom he speaks in terms
of the greatest affection) his manor of Allington, _alias_ Aylton,

His sons, Heneage and Henry, and son-in-law, William Downhall, were
appointed Executors.

Sir Peter Proby’s arms were, erm. on a fesse gu. a lyon pass. or. a
crescent for difference.


WILLIAM CLOWES.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

WILLIAM CLOWES was the son of Thomas Clowes, originally of Kingsbury,
Warwickshire, and afterwards of London. He was born about 1540, and
studied surgery under Mr. George Keble, who was not free of our
Company, but of whom Clowes more than once speaks in terms of highest
praise. He tells us that in 1563 he served as a Surgeon in the army
under the Earl of Warwick at Havre, and after this campaign he was for
some time in the Navy, in both which appointments he undoubtedly gained
great experience. In 1569 he no doubt settled in London, as on the 8th
of November in that year he was admitted to the freedom by translation,
and he soon secured a large practice, though it was not until the 18th
July, 1588, that he was made an Assistant of the Court.

The records do not display Mr. Clowes’ character in the most favourable
light, as the following extracts will show:--

  6th October, 1573. Here was one & complayned [against] Willm̄ Clowes
  for takynge his money and he not cured.

  7th February, 1575. Here came one Willm̄ Goodnep and complayned of
  Willm̄ Clowes for not curing his wief de morbo gallico and yt was
  awarded that the saide Clowes sholde either geve the saide Goodnep
  xx{s} orells cure his saide wief w{ch} Clowes agreed to pay the xx{s}
  and so they were agreed and eche of them made acquittance to other.

  28th February, 1576. Here was a complainte against Willm̄ Clowes by
  one Goodenge for that the saide Clowes had not onlie misused the
  saide Goodinge in speche but also most of the masters of the Company
  w{th} scoffing wordes and jestes, and they all forgave him here
  openlye in the Co{r}te and so the stryfe was ended upon condˀ that he
  sholde nev{r} so misuse him self agayne and bonds was caused to be
  made to that effect.

  25th March, 1577. Here at this Corte was a greate contension and
  stryffe spoken of and ended betwene George Baker and Willm̄ Clowes
  for that they bothe contrary to order and the good and holsome rules
  of this howse misused eche other and fought in the ffelds togethers.
  But the M{r} Wardens and assistance wishing that they might be and
  continewe loving brothers pˀdoned this greate offence in hope of
  amendement.

The George Baker with whom Clowes fought, was afterwards
Serjeant-Surgeon and Master of the Company in 1597. In 1575 Mr. Clowes
was appointed one of the surgeons of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and
later on he was surgeon to Christ’s Hospital; he was also surgeon to
Queen Elizabeth and James I. His first book, “De morbo Gallico,” was
published in 1579. In 1585 he went as surgeon of the forces in the
expedition to the Low Countries under the Earl of Leicester. In his
book, “Proved Practise,” he tells a great deal of this expedition and
says that many of the surgeons were most unskilful and “slew more than
the enemy did,” though he and his friend Serjeant-Surgeon Gooderus
(Master 1594) did not lose a case. Mr. Clowes had the honour of serving
in the fleet which defeated the Spanish Armada, and in 1594 was Warden
of the Barber-Surgeons, the last Court which he attended was on the 9th
February, 1596. After a successful practice he retired to a country
house at Plaistow, in Essex, and died in 1604. Dr. Norman Moore says
that his books “are the best surgical writings of the Elizabethan age;
they are all in English, and his style is very easy and forcible,
sometimes a little prolix but never obscure.”


WILLIAM CLOWES, JUN., SERJEANT-SURGEON.

He was the son of William Clowes, Barber-Surgeon; born about 1582,
he was apprenticed to his father and admitted to our freedom 22nd
January, 1605, and on 13th December, 1615, called to the Livery; he
was then surgeon to the Prince of Wales, and had a dispensation from
the Court of the Company to attend the lectures and Hall only on such
occasions as should be convenient to him. On the accession of Charles I
he was made Serjeant-Surgeon to the King. In 1626 he was Master of the
Company, and again in 1638. A characteristic letter of Serjeant Clowes
and some particulars as to his election as Master in 1626 may be seen
on pp. 248-250. On 30th October, 1648, his decease was reported to the
Court.

By his will, dated 28th March, 1630, he bequeathed his property
freehold and copyhold, to his wife Sara, his son James, and his
daughters Ann and Sara.

THOMAS THORNEY.

THOMAS THORNEY, born in 1542 or 1543, was apprenticed to William
Bovey (Master 1581) a surgeon in large practice. He was made free 8th
April, 1573, and elected an Assistant 19th June, 1595; he served as
Warden in 1598 and 1600 and was twice Master of the Company, viz., in
1602 and 1606, he was also a Common Councilman. Mr. Thorney acquired
considerable property in Holborn and the country, but dying on 4th
June, 1614, without issue, made his nephew Peter (son of his then
deceased brother Walter) his heir. He was a considerable benefactor to
the Parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, where there is a monumental tablet
to his memory. His Will dated 25th May, 1612, was proved on the day of
his death, and among other bequests to St. Andrew’s Holborn, he left
£10 to the Churchwardens--

  to make a Dynner or supper therwith and to make merrie therewith with
  my good neighboures for my sake and to encrease neighbourelie love
  amongest them And the Churchwardens to bid the parson and Minister
  to be with them. Item I give to the Company of Barbar Surgions twoe
  spowte pottꝭ of silver and guilt one all guilte and the other
  parcell guilte to the valewe of twentie poundes and the Thorne bushe
  to be graven on either of them and the Barber Surgeons armes and my
  name at lardge and some wordes to shewe that they were of my guifte
  Item I give likewise to the Company of Barbor surgions of London that
  shall followe me at my ffunerall fyve poundꝭ to make a Dynner with
  and to be merrye for my sake and to the entent to encrease brotherlie
  love amongest them The said ffyve poundes to be paied to the Master
  and Wardens when they come to fetch my bodye to the churche.

To his wife Annie he gave his dwelling house in Holborn, and another
newly built house there, also one on the street side next the Bars, and
the third part of all his other lands for her life and all his goods
and movables. To Richard Cade “my auncient and honest servaunte” and
to Jane his wife 40_s._ each for rings. To his nephew, Peter Thorney,
his houses in Fetter Lane, the Bell Inn at Acton, a dwelling house at
Acton, and the King’s Head in Holborn near the Bars, with a proviso
that should Peter die without heirs the Bell at Acton was to pass to
the Barber-Surgeons.


PETER THORNEY.

PETER THORNEY was apprenticed to his uncle Thomas Thorney and admitted
to the freedom 14th July, 1603. He seems to have got into good practice
and was one of the Army Surgeons. He was appointed Surgeon-General
of the Army going to the relief of Rochelle, and made his will a few
days afterwards (25th July, 1628) with a presentiment of his death,
which was soon realised, as probate was granted on the 24th November
following. He says--

  I com̃end my bodie to bee buried where it shall please god or my
  freindes, if I come not home from the Sea this voiage I intended for
  the releife of Rochell, but if it shall please god that I die in
  England if it maiebee possible I would bee buried in S{t} Andrews
  Church as neare to my Unckle M{r} Thomas Thorney as maie bee.

Among other bequests he gives five marks to such of the livery of the
Company as shall follow him to the Church; he makes his son Thomas
(then under age) his heir generally and provides for his wife Ann and
daughter Elizabeth; he leaves to George Peren, Barber-Surgeon, his
“yearball knowne by the name of Gerardꝭ yearball.”[338]

[338] Gerard’s Herball.

  But if it shall please god soe that both my children shall die
  without issue Then my will is that y{e} Bell in Acton shall remaine
  for evˀ to the Company of the berber surgeons of London according as
  my unckle M{r} Thomas Thorney hath hertofore bequeathed it.

  Item I give to Edward Griffith which was my Servant all my
  manuscriptꝭ belonginge to surgerie and all my instrumentꝭ belonging
  to Surgery except my plaster box and salvatory and instruments in the
  boxe and my silver seringe, and likewise unto the said Edward all my
  medicines whatsoever I give him w{th} my bookes of Surgery whatsoever
  in my Studdie.


JOHN GERARD.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

JOHN GERARD was born in 1545 at Nantwich in Cheshire, his parentage
is unknown, though by his coat of arms he appears to have descended
from the Gerards of Ince in Lancashire. In 1562 he was apprenticed to
Alexander Mason, a Surgeon in extensive practice, who was Warden in
1556 and 1561 and Master in 1567 and 1573 (Mr. Mason died 3rd April,
1574). Gerard was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons 9th
December, 1569. There is no record of his admission to the Livery,
though in consequence of his professional attainments and his
presumable friendship with his master who made him free, he doubtless
had the clothing at the same time. The only note we have of Gerard,
before he comes on the Court, is one in which he appears before the
Masters as defendant in a case of alleged slander on the wife of a
brother freeman.

  21st February, 1578. Here was a complainte against Jo: Jerrard for
  saying that Richard James his wief had the ffrenche pocks, and he
  made answere and saide he wolde justifie the same, and he was dismist
  to the Comon Lawe.

Gerard was elected a Member of the Court of Assistants on the 19th
June, 1595. For some long time previous he must have been engaged in
the preparation of his great work “_The Herball or Generall Historie of
Plantes_,” a folio of some 1,400 pages, embellished with about 1,800
illustrations of plants,[339] and published in 1597, which, whilst
it was by far the best and most exhaustive work of its kind at that
period, has ever since been considered a standard book of reference;  a
good copy being now worth 8 to 10 guineas. At this period he was living
“at my house in Holburne, within the suburbs of London,” probably near
Fetter Lane, where he had a large garden of herbs.

[339] The woodcuts for these illustrations were procured from
Frankfort, and originally executed for the German Herbal of
Tabernæmontanus.

The style of Gerard’s writing was very quaint, and abounds with quiet
humour; he scouted monkish tales and old wives’ fables concerning the
miraculous properties of plants, etc., honestly endeavouring to present
facts to his readers; yet even he has not hesitated to record as true,
and gravely set forth, some fabulous stories, as, for example, in
speaking of Barnacles on p. 1391, he says--

  There is a small Ilande in Lancashire called the Pile of Foulders,
  wherein are found the broken peeces of old and brused ships . . .
  wheron is found a certaine spume or froth, that in time breedeth unto
  certaine shels, in shape like those of the muskle, . . . wherein is
  conteined a thing in forme like a lace of silke finely woven, as it
  were togither, of a whitish colour; one end whereof is fastned unto
  the inside of the shell; . . . the other end is made fast unto the
  belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which in time commeth to the shape &
  forme of a Bird: when it is perfectly formed, the shel gapeth open, &
  the first thing that appeereth is the foresaid lace or string; next
  come the legs of the Birde hanging out; and as it groweth greater, it
  openeth the shell by degrees, till at length it is all come foorth,
  and hangeth onely by the bill; in short space after it commeth
  to full maturitie, and falleth into the sea, where it gathereth
  feathers, and groweth to a foule, bigger then a Mallard, and lesser
  than a Goose; having blacke legs and bill or beake, and feathers
  blacke and white, spotted in such maner as is our Magge-Pie, called
  in some places a Pie-Annet, which the people of Lancashire call by no
  other name than a tree goose; which place aforesaide, and all those
  parts adjoining, do so much abound therewith, that one of the best
  is bought for three pence: for the truth heerof, if any doubt, may
  it please them to repaire unto me, and I shall satisfie them by the
  testimonie of good witnesses.

The woodcut illustrations with which the book abounds are designed
in a good artistic style, being frequently consulted and adapted
nowadays by artists engaged in floral design. In 1596, Gerard seems
to have propounded a scheme for the Company to keep a garden for the
cultivation and study of medicinal plants, and some land belonging to
the Company in East Smithfield was suggested for this purpose, but not
being thought a suitable spot, certain members of the Court offered to
contribute towards the purchase of a garden elsewhere; in June, 1597,
the subject was under consideration, and again in November, 1602; but
whether anything further was done in the matter does not appear. The
minutes in our books relating to this business, are as follows--

  26th March, 1596. A motion was also made concerninge the Demisinge
  of certen garden grounds at East Smithfield for the w{ch} M{r}
  ffettyplace, M{r} Lacock and John Gerard were sevˀall Sutors. Yt was
  agreed that the same should be let for yerely rent at the pleasures
  of the masters or governors and none of the said sutors obteyned any
  graunte. But for as muche as John Gerard’s request was to have yt to
  make a garden of yt for the ffurtherance of learning in the knowledge
  and practiqe of the nature and skill of herbes, w{ch} was thought
  not a place ffytt for that pˀpose, but that a more convenient place
  should be sought owte and dyvers of the Companie did offer to be
  contributors for the buying of the same, and M{r} ffetiplace and M{r}
  Lacock are to be spoken w{th}all and thus to be satisfied.

  16th June, 1597. At the request of M{r} Peck[340] and M{r} Gerat
  yt was agreed at this Corte that those whose names are here after
  menc͠oned should survey a peece of ground ffyt to make a Garden for
  to plant all kinde of herbes in routes plantes and suche like as to
  the saide M{r} Gerat being a skilfull Herbalist should thinck meete
  for the wo{r}shipp of this societie, and to relate their opinions and
  acc͠ons therein to this howse and societie for the further pˀceding
  therein, viz{t} M{r} John Isard[341] M{r} Lewes Atmer[342] M{r} Cox

  2nd November, 1602. This daye it is ordered that the Committes for
  M{r} Gerrard’s garden shall this aft{r} noone meet at the hall to
  consider of the report for a Garden for the said M{r} Gerrard.

In August, 1597, John Gerard was chosen Junior Warden (George Baker,
the Queen’s Serjeant-Surgeon being at the same time elected Master),
and in January following he was appointed one of the Examiners of
Surgeons. In 1604, there had been controversies between Gerard and
Christopher Frederick (Master 1609), which on the 12th June were
referred to a Committee of the Court for settlement. “And if they
no ende can make they are to make report at the next Court of their
pˀcedinges therein.”

  26th September, 1605. This day M{r} Jerrard was discharged of the
  office of second Warden and upper governo{r} of this Company uppon
  his suite & entreatie for certayne considerac͠ons. And is fyned for
  the said places at x{li} which he is pˀntlie to pay to the pˀnte
  M{rs} or governours And is hereafter to take his place as though he
  had served the place of upper Governo{r} any thinge to the contrarie
  notwithstandinge.

7th November, 1605. The above order was rescinded, but shortly
afterwards Mr. Gerard brought £10 into Court, and left it with the
Wardens, when it was ordered that the matter should be further
considered, and in the result the fine was accepted.

  21st October, 1606. This daie John Gerrard was fyned at vj{s} viij{d}
  for abuseing M{r} Peck and it is ordered that from henceforth they
  shall be freinds, and all Controversyes betweene them are to cease.

20th July, 1607. Mr. Gerard was again appointed an Examiner of
Surgeons, and 17th August following elected Master.

Queen Elizabeth is reported to have entertained a high opinion of Mr.
Gerard’s attainments, and he was also patronised by her Minister,
William Cecil, Lord Burleigh, whose garden he superintended for twenty
years. In the dedication of his Herbal to Lord Burleigh, in speaking of
the “care and studie” of herbs, he says--

  Under your Lordship I have served, and that way imployed my
  principall studie, and almost all my time now by the space of twenty
  yeeres. To the large and singular furniture of this noble Iland, I
  have added from forren places all the varietie of herbes and flowers
  that I might any way obtaine, I have laboured with the soile to make
  it fit for the plants, and with the plants to make them to delight in
  the soile, that so they might live and prosper under our climate, as
  in their native and proper countrie: what my successe hath beene, and
  what my furniture is, I leave to the report of them that have seene
  your Lordships gardens, and the little plot of my speciall care and
  husbandrie.

Among the numerous epistles, etc., laudatory of Gerard, prefixed to
the Herbal are some exceedingly quaint verses dedicated by “Thomas
Thorney[353] Master in Chirurgerie, to his learned friend and loving
brother in Art, M. John Gerard.” There is also an epistle by “George
Baker, one of hir Maiesties chiefe Chirurgions in ordinarie, and M. of
the Chirurgions of the Citie of London.” Besides his garden in Holborn,
Gerard seems also to have had one in the Strand by Somerset House,
and to have held the appointment of “Herbarist” to James I, for among
the Domestic State papers at the Record Office, is a grant dated 10th
October, 1603, by Anne, Queen of James I to Sir Robert Cecil, Lord
Cecil of Essingdon, of the Keepership of Somerset House with all the
orchards, walks, gardens, &c., thereto belonging “except and alwaies
reserved to John Gerrard of London Surgeon and herbarist to his Ma{tie}
all that garden plott or peece of ground w{th} all and singular pˀfittꝭ
comodities and other the app̃tencꝭ therew{th} graunted and demised unto
him by one lease given under o{r} hand and seale at”[354] . . .

[353] See p. 538.

[354] The lease was dated 14th August, 1603, and was for 2 acres of
land for Gerard’s life at a yearly rent of four pence, with a tribute
of herbs, &c., if demanded.

In 1639 the Company purchased a copy of Gerard’s work for the Library.
“Paid for M{r} John Gerrardꝭ herball for the library for Claspes &
settinge on the chaine . . . . . xxv{s} vj{d.}”

John Gerard died in February, 1612, and was buried at St. Andrew’s,
Holborn, on the 18th of that month. There is a fine portrait of Gerard
facing page 1 of the Herbal, in which he is represented holding a
potato plant in his hand; below are the arms of the Barber-Surgeons
and his own coat, viz., quarterly 1st and 4th ar. a lyon rampant erm.

The best account of Gerard may be seen in a privately-printed
“Catalogue of Plants cultivated in the Garden of John Gerard and a life
of the Author,” by Benjamin D. Jackson, F.L.S. London, 1876.


SIR THOMAS BLUDDER.

Sir THOMAS was the son of Sir Thomas Bludder, of Flanchford, in the
parish of Reigate (who died 1st November, 1618). He was knighted at
Whitehall, 22nd April, 1618, and married three times, his third wife
being Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Brett, of Rotherby, Lancashire.

  9th August, 1621. At this Court upon the request of Sir Thomas
  Bludder Knyght who was desierous to be made a freman of this Company
  It was ordered he shold be made free & so tooke his oath accordingly.

Sir Thomas, who was a Justice of the Peace for Surrey, represented
Reigate in the several Parliaments of 21 James I, and 1, 3 and 16
Charles I. He was a Royalist and imprisoned for his adherence to that
cause, and died on 29th September, 1655.

A pedigree of the Bludders will be found in Aubrey’s Antiquities of
Surrey, IV, 210.

MARTIN BROWNE.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

MARTIN BROWNE was born about 1590, probably in Lincolnshire; he was
apprenticed to Thomas Clemence, a surgeon free of the Company, and on
13th July, 1613, was admitted to the freedom. He seems to have had an
extensive practice, and in 1648 was living in Creed Lane. There are
numerous references to him in our Minutes, from which may be gathered
that he was a man of great experience, and well able to hold his own in
some cases where his professional skill had been called in question by
jealous brethren of the craft. He served as Warden in 1640 and 1645,
and was Master in 1653, when he presented the Company with a loving
cup (_see_ p. 502). He died 16th April, 1655, and in his will dated
20th August, 1654, and proved 24th April, 1655, he describes himself

EDWARD ARRIS, ALDERMAN.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

Few names are held in greater veneration at Barbers’ Hall than that
of Edward Arris. His father, Jasper Arris, was apprenticed to Thomas
Burston or Burstowe, a Surgeon and Master of the Company in 1576.
Jasper Arris (probably born 1560-2), was admitted to the freedom, 3rd
April, 1583, chosen a Liveryman, 22nd January, 1606, an Assistant, 3rd
August, 1614, served as Warden in the years 1617 and 1622, and was
reported on 8th January, 1623, as then recently deceased. There are
few notices of Jasper in our books, and one of them on 21st October,
1606, is perhaps not much to his credit, as it records his fine for
working on the Sabbath day; from which we may gather that he was one
of those who, contrary to the Ordinances and the Statute, worked both
as a Barber and Surgeon,--a practice often winked at by the Governors.
His son Edward, was born in London in 1591, and was admitted to the
freedom by patrimony on 21st January, 1617, having learnt his art with
his father; he was admitted to the Livery 9th October, 1627, and on
30th April, 1629, granted his diploma to practise Surgery. In 1632, he
was chosen Steward, and the next year Master of the Anatomy. On the
23rd April, 1640, he was elected an Assistant and served the office of
Warden in 1642. On 10th February, 1648, he was appointed one of the
Examiners of Surgeons, and elected Master of the Company 1651. On 3rd
July, 1663, Mr. Arris was nominated by the Court of Aldermen, Alderman
of the Ward of Bridge Without (_loco_ Richard Evans) and was sworn
in on the 28th July following, but this civic office was probably an
uncongenial one to him, for he very shortly afterwards applied to be
discharged from it, and thereupon paid a fine of £300 to the City.

In 1645 Mr. Arris founded an Anatomy Lecture, and with a characteristic
modesty endeavoured to conceal the founder’s name, though his intention
in this respect was necessarily frustrated when the deed of settlement
had to be drawn. This, the Arrisian Lecture, still survives at the
Royal College of Surgeons. (Particulars of the foundation will be
found on pp. 368, 369.) In 1649, when our plate was sold, Mr. Arris
re-purchased King Henry VIII’s cup, and “freely gave it againe to this
Company,” for which all Barber-Surgeons and Barbers have ever after
been profoundly grateful to him. He also, in 1651, gave us four silver
cups. Mr. Arris’ granddaughter, Henrietta Maria Langford, seems to have
got into straitened circumstances, as on 5th August, 1718, we read “It
is ordered that Henrietta Maria Langford daughter of Robert Arris son
of Alderman Arris Members of this Company, shall be made free without
charge, in Gratitude to the Memory of Alderman Arris, in order that
she may be admitted one of the Company’s Pentioners.”

The Alderman died 28th May, 1676, at the good old age of eighty-five
and is buried in St. Sepulchre’s Church, where there is a quaint tablet
with this inscription--

By his Will, dated 20th May, 1676, he directs his body to be buried in
the grave of his father, mother and wife in St. Sepulchre’s, and he
bequeathed his property to his then only surviving son Thomas Arris,
M.D., M.P., and his children, and to the children of his deceased
son Robert. He gave five legacies of £400 each and some smaller ones
amongst his grandchildren and an annuity of £30 a year to his grandson
Robert. He also bequeathed messuages, lands, &c., at Hatfield, two
messuages in Well Yard, St. Bartholomew’s the Less, a messuage near
Pye Corner, ten acres of Copyhold land in the manor of Bedwell near
Hatfield and four freehold houses in the parish of St. Paul, Covent
Garden, to his son and grandchildren. “I give Ten shillings a peece

left £8 to the poor of St. Sepulchre’s to be given to 160 poor at his
burial; £5 to the poor of St. Bartholomew the Less; £5 to Christ’s
Hospital among 100 children to attend his burial; 20_s._ each to the
two Beadles of the Barber-Surgeons, and 5_s._ each to the four Beadles
of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital; also £5 to Dr. Bell to preach a sermon
at his burial.

SIR JOHN FREDERICK.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

JOHN FREDERICK was a son of Christopher Frederick, Barber-Surgeon. A
minute of the 9th June, 1595, states that “the said Xpõfer ffrederick
being a strainger borne had his ffreedom geven him of the Cittie of
London by vertue of her Mat{ies} most gracious Lrẽs to the Lord maior
and Corte of Aldrem̃e directed and was made fre of this Companie and
after chosen of the lyvery and then one of Thassistance.”

Christopher Frederick was on more than one occasion at serious variance
with the Court, as also with some of its members, and a resolution was
passed, evidently with pointed allusion to him, viz., that in future
aliens should be ineligible for the Court. He was Serjeant-Surgeon
to James I, and probably to Elizabeth also; Master in 1609 and again
in 1616. His son William was admitted to the freedom by service 27th
October, 1607. Christopher Frederick was buried 10th October, 1623,
in the church of St. Olave, Jewry, where also Mary, his widow, was
interred on 6th June, 1636. They had issue six sons and six daughters.

John Frederick, the fourth son, was baptized 25th October, 1601, and
educated at Christ’s Hospital. On 17th July, 1632 he was admitted
to the freedom by patrimony, on the 13th November, 1635 elected to
the Livery, and on 30th January, 1645 made an Assistant. He was a
successful merchant and resided in a large mansion on the site of what
is now Frederick’s Place, Old Jewry (which he rebuilt after the Great
Fire in 1666). This house was afterwards used as the Excise Office,
upon the removal of which to Broad Street, the building was taken down
and the present houses erected. He was elected Alderman of Vintry
September, 1653, and in 1660 removed to Coleman Street Ward. He was
Master of the Barber-Surgeons in 1654 and again in 1658; he served as
Sheriff, 1655-6, and was then knighted. The Barber-Surgeons attended
Sir John in their barge to Westminster when he went to be sworn in as
Sheriff, and ordered his portrait to be painted at a cost of £15. This
fine picture representing the Sheriff in his robes and with a flowing
wig, is preserved at Barbers’ Hall. In 1661 Sir John was translated to
the Grocers’ Company to enable him to take upon him the office of Lord
Mayor, which he served 1661-2. The pageant performed at the expense of
the Grocers upon his accession to the Mayoralty was entitled “Londons
Tryumphs presented in several delightfull Scænes,” and was composed
by John Tatham; a copy of this very rare tract is preserved in the
Guildhall Library. Pepys, under date 29th October, 1661, writes--

  This day I put on my half cloth black stockings and my new coate of
  the fashion, which pleases me well, and with my bever I was (after
  office was done) ready to go to my Lord Mayor’s feast, as we are all
  invited; but the Sir Williams were both loth to go, because of the
  crowd, and so none of us went. My mind not pleased because I had
  proposed a great deal of pleasure to myself this day at Guildhall.
  This Lord Mayor, it seems, brings up again the custom of Lord Mayors
  going the day of their instalment to Paul’s and walking round about
  the Crosse, and offering something at the Altar.

In 1662 Sir John was elected Master of the Grocers’ Company and also
President of Christ’s Hospital, which latter office he held until 1683.
In the Parliament of 1660 he represented Dartmouth; on the 10th March,
1663, he was elected one of the Members for the City and so continued
until the dissolution in January, 1679. In 1674 he gave £100 towards
rebuilding Barber-Surgeons’ Hall; he also repaired and fitted up the
Great Hall at Christ’s Hospital at a cost of £5,000. In 1664 he bore
the expense of bringing the Conduit Water from Gray’s Inn Fields to
the Hospital. In 1667 he gave £50 and twenty chaldrons of sea coal,
and by his Will bequeathed £500 to the Hospital. In 1654 he gave a
handsome silver loving cup and cover weighing about 38 oz. to the
Barber-Surgeons; this cup is still used on festive occasions. There is
a portrait of Sir John at Christ’s Hospital, which represents him as
seated in an arm chair, in his civic robes, with an open letter in his
hand, on his head is a full bottomed wig and a black cap, he has white
whiskers and a tuft of white hair on his under lip.

In the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for November, 1769, is a copy of a
document prepared for Charles II, giving the characters of the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen, which says of Sir John Frederick that--

  by reason of his age, he is apt to be ledd by others, especially by
  Sir John Lawrence, a man of little dispatch, very readie to run into
  mistakes; he hates a souldier, and cannot endure to see any of the
  King’s guards.

Sir John married Mary Rous by whom he had issue four sons and nine
daughters. Judith, his eldest daughter, married Sir Nathaniel Herne
(Alderman and Sheriff 1674 and Master of the Barber-Surgeons 1674),
who, dying in August, 1679, she married secondly, Robert Hooker, of
Hatton Garden. Her Will, dated in 1688, was proved 30th June, 1691.

Sir John Frederick was buried in the Church of St. Olave Jewry 19th
March, 1685, where his widow was also interred 19th December, 1689; she
bequeathed £300 to Christ’s Hospital. His eldest son Thomas was the
father of John Frederick who was created a baronet 10th June, 1723. Sir
John gave marriage portions of £3,000 apiece to his daughters Judith
and Elizabeth, who married respectively Sir Nathaniel Herne and Sir
Joseph Herne, and he covenanted to give £2,000 apiece more either in
his lifetime or by will; it seems that he did this by will, which led
to litigation, his relict (to whom he left about £10,000) laying claim
to some portion of these legacies by the custom of London.

SIR NATHANIEL HERNE.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

Sir NATHANIEL HERNE was the son of Nicholas and grandson of Richard
Herne (Alderman and Sheriff in 1618). He was born in 1629 and in 1646
apprenticed at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall to Sir John Frederick, one of the
merchant-princes of London at that time. Herne was admitted to the
freedom on 7th May, 1655, and, like the typical industrious apprentice,
he married his master’s daughter, Judith Frederick, by whom he had
(among others) a daughter Judith who married William, second Earl of
Jersey, and thereby was one of the ancestors of the present Earl. Sir
Nathaniel Herne was a most successful merchant and amassed a large
fortune. In 1674 he was Sheriff of London (being knighted at Windsor on
the 9th August) and Master of this Company. On the 11th April, 1676, he
was elected Alderman of the Ward of Billingsgate. He was sometime M.P.
for Dartmouth, and a Governor of the East India Company. He died 16th
August, 1679, being then fifty years of age and was buried at St. Olave
Jewry, where there is a monument to his memory, with his arms impaling
Frederick, and this inscription:--

  Here lyeth in hopes of a Glorious Resurrection the body of S{r}

between his wife and children, and legacies to Sir John and Lady
Frederick, Ephraim Skinner and numerous other friends and relatives.

SIR JOHN LETHIEULLIER.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

Sir JOHN LETHIEULLIER, who was born in 1633, was descended from the
Le Thieulliers, an old Protestant family in the Low Countries; his
great grandfather John was burnt at Valenciennes for his religion
by the infamous Duke D’Alva. His grandfather John was a merchant at
Cologne and died there in 1593. His widow survived him thirty-eight
years and came over to England in 1605 with her only son John, who was
born in 1591. In 1620 he was established as a Merchant in London, but
on the breaking out of the Civil Wars he went over to Amsterdam and
returned to England at the Restoration; he lived at Lewisham, where he
died on 2nd November, 1679, having married Jane, daughter of John de
la Fortre, of London, by whom he had five sons and three daughters.
His eldest son, Sir John Lethieullier, was apprenticed to Sir John
Frederick (Barber-Surgeon) and admitted to the freedom by servitude
11th November, 1657. He served the office of Master in 1676, having
been Sheriff of London in 1674. He was a successful merchant and a rich
man, having a great fortune by his wife Anne, daughter of Sir William
Hooker, who was Lord Mayor in 1673. Sir John was a free brother of
the Company of Merchant Adventurers of England, and of the Society of
Merchants of London Trading to the Levant Seas and the East Indies.
His third brother, Sir Christopher Lethieullier was Sheriff of London,
1689, and died 1690. On the 20th November, 1707, Sir John wrote to the
Court asking to be relieved from the office of an Assistant on account
of his indisposition and age (he was then 74), but the Court, out of a
feeling of respect towards him, refused to accept his resignation,
and ordered that the Wardens should have a personal interview with him
to know his pleasure. This was done, and on the 15th January following
his resignation was accepted. Sir John, who resided at Greenwich, died
there on the 4th January, 1719, having had two sons, John and William
(both of whom were free of the Company), and three daughters.

[Illustration: Family tree]

Sir John Lethieullier’s will, of prodigious length, is dated 6th May,
1709, and he therein directs that he shall be buried in the vault in
Greenwich Church with his late wife. To his two daughters, Letitia
and Leonora he gave £10,200 each, and to his married daughter, Lady
Ann Dodwell, whom he had previously provided for, £1,000. To all his
grandchildren £100 each. To Christ’s and St. Thomas’ Hospitals and to
the French Congregation in Threadneedle Street £100 each, numerous
gifts to the poor in various parishes, and bequests to friends,
relatives and servants for mourning and rings. All his lands and houses
in the City of London (except two) and in the county of Essex to his
son John. Two houses on College Hill, late in the occupation of Sir
Henry Furnese and Sir Alexander Cairnes, to his two daughters, also his
house and land at Lewisham, his best coach and chariot horses, live
stock, &c. All his other freeholds and houses in Beckenham, Lewisham
and Battersea, his lands at Dartford and his manor of Sutton at Hone
and Wilmington to his son William. There are four codicils to this Will
and by one of them (19th July, 1714) he gave the manor of Rowhill,
which he had then lately purchased to his son William. His two sons
were appointed executors.

EPHRAIM SKINNER.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

EPHRAIM SKINNER was born at Barnstaple 30th November, 1637. In 1652 he
was apprenticed to Sir John Frederick, and afterwards became a wealthy
Merchant trading with Spain. He was sometime the British Consul at
Livorne. On 25th April, 1665, he was admitted to the freedom of the
Barber-Surgeons, and in 1673 gave us the chimney piece in the Court
Room, where there is a three-quarter portrait of him in his livery
gown, with full wig and rich lace bands; on the portrait is this
inscription: “M{r} Ephraim Skiner Marcht. & one of y{e} Assistants of
this Compy: of Barbersurgeons Lond: gave y{m} besides other gifts 300£
for 20 years.”

By his Will, dated 27th December, 1677, he gave to the Governors of
Christ’s Hospital (of which he was a member) five acres of pasture in
Islington, also £700 in trust for them to lend the Barber-Surgeons £300
for 20 years without interest to help them to pay their debts, and also
for a payment of 5_s._ a week to the Minister of Islington for him to
expound and “chatecize” every Sunday afternoon and to pay £5 a year
to the poor of Islington, to whom he also bequeathed a sum of £50. To
the poor of the Old Jewry £50. To the poor of Barnstaple £200. To the
rebuilding of St. Paul’s £50. To his father-in-law Peter Rowe £25 per
annum for life. To several members of the Barber-Surgeons, including
Sir J. Frederick, Sir N. Herne, Sir J. Lethieullier and their children
£10 each, and numerous legacies of money to friends and relations. The
residue of his Estate to his wife.

SIR HUMPHRY EDWIN.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

Sir HUMPHRY EDWIN, descended from an old Herefordshire family, was born
at Hereford in 1642. He was the only son of William Edwin (sometime
Mayor of Hereford) by his wife Anne Mansfield, and grandson of William
Edwin of the Field next Hereford. One of his sisters (Mary) was
married to Sir Edward Dering. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel
Sambrooke, a London merchant, and a sister of Sir Jeremy Sambrooke;
by her he had four sons, born between 1671 and 1677, viz., Samuel,
Humphry, Thomas and Charles.

On the 3rd February, 1679, he was admitted to our freedom; on
11th October, 1687, he was sworn in Alderman of Tower Ward on the
direct appointment of James II; on the 18th November following he
was knighted at Whitehall, and a few weeks later appointed Sheriff
of Glamorganshire, in which county he had purchased considerable
estates. In 1688 Edwin was chosen Sheriff of London and Master of the
Barber-Surgeons. In 1689 he took official part in the Proclamation
of William and Mary in the City, and shortly after was appointed a
Commissioner of Excise with a salary of £1,000; he was also an officer
in the Honourable Artillery Company, and a Colonel of the Trained Bands.

In 1691 Edwin was the victim of a malicious prosecution; he was
indicted for perjury, and a true bill found against him, but on his
trial was acquitted, Lord Chief Justice Holt not calling on him to
swear all his witnesses. Sir Humphry owned extensive property near
Westminster Hall, he also had a mansion at Kensington, and added to
his Glamorganshire property the castle and lordship of Ogmore. In
1697 his eldest son Samuel was married to Lady Catharine Montagu,
daughter of the Earl of Manchester, and the same year Sir Humphry was
elected Lord Mayor of London, having been previously translated from
the Barber-Surgeons to the Skinners’ Company. The customary mayoralty
pageant was omitted, owing, doubtless, to Edwin’s religious scruples,
he being a Nonconformist. Soon after his admission as Lord Mayor, he
gave great offence by attending Nonconformist worship at a conventicle
on the afternoons of Sunday, 31st October and 7th November, in full
civic state. A meeting of the Court of Aldermen was held 9th November
to consider a complaint of the Swordbearer against the Lord Mayor,
for compelling his attendance on the occasion when the Lord Mayor was
deserted by all his officers except the Swordbearer, whom one of the
chapel officials had locked in a pew! According to the minute, the
Court took notice that the Lord Mayor had “for two Lords dayes past in
the afternoones gone to private meetings with the sword,” whereupon
his Lordship promised to forbear the practice for the future. Edwin’s
action roused all the bitterness of the High Church party and caused an
angry literary controversy in which Dr. Nicholls, James Peirce, Calamy
and Defoe joined, and in which the question of “occasional conformity”
was raised. Edwin had on his election received the Sacrament in
accordance with the rites of the Church of England, and his friend
Defoe took him very severely to task for this, charging him with having
“played bo-peep with God Almighty.”

On the 19th April, 1694, Sir Humphry Edwin was dismissed from the
Court of Assistants of our Company on account of his continued
non-attendance. He died 14th December, 1707, at his country seat at
Llanmihangel, intestate, administration being granted to his son
Charles on 19th February following. His widow died in London 22nd
November, 1714. Besides the children already mentioned he had four
daughters and a fifth son John, from whom is descended the present Earl
of Crawford and Balcarres.

SIR WILLIAM STEWART.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

Sir WILLIAM STEWART was admitted to the freedom 22nd July, 1686, by
redemption. In 1706 he was one of the Directors of the East India
Company. On 31st July, 1711, he was elected Alderman of Cripplegate,
and the following year was knighted.

  21st July, 1720. The Master acquainted the Court That S{r} William
  Stewart Kn{t} and Alderman of the City of London a Freeman of this
  Company being the Senior Alderman under the Chair of this City except
  one Did make it his request to this Court That he might be translated
  from this Company to the Company of Goldsmiths forasmuch as it was
  required by the Custom of London That he should be free of one of the
  first twelve Companys of this City before he could be put in elecc͠on
  to be Lord Mayor.

Sir William was Lord Mayor for the year 1721-2, and died at his house
in Mark Lane, 29th April, 1723. His corpse was carried, preceded by
a hundred boys of Christ’s Hospital and fifty boys belonging to the
London Workhouse, each with a wax taper in his hand, and was interred
at Guildhall Chapel 7th May following.

His Will is dated 28th March, 1723, and by it he bequeaths various
legacies of £2,000 each to nephews and nieces, and sundry other
smaller legacies to friends and servants, etc. £700 to St.
Bartholomews, and £100 each to St. Thomas’, Christ’s and Bethlem
Hospitals. £50 to the London Workhouse, £500 to his housekeeper Mrs.

CHARLES BERNARD, SERJEANT-SURGEON.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

CHARLES BERNARD, who was born about 1656, was a son of Samuel Bernard,
D.D., of Croydon. On 16th August, 1670 (his father being then dead), he
was apprenticed to Henry Boone, Surgeon, for seven years, and on 4th
December, 1677, was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons; on
25th October, 1697, he was chosen an Assistant, and on 8th November,
1700, an Examiner of Surgeons in the place of Thomas Lichfield. In 1702
he was appointed Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen Anne, and in 1703 he was
Master of the Company. One of his brothers, Dr. Francis Bernard, was
physician to James II, and he had another brother, Dr. William Bernard.
Charles Bernard died at Lord Weymouth’s house, Long Leate, Wilts,
on 9th October, 1710, and shortly afterwards the Company caused his
portrait to be painted. There is a Latin inscription below it which is
highly eulogistic of Bernard, the following being a translation:--

  This portrait of Charles Bernard Esquire, Royal Surgeon in Chief,
  most learned in Greek and Latin letters, most experienced, candid
  and upright in his profession, enjoying the greatest favour with
  the Most Serene Queen Anne, the greatest fame among the laity, the
  greatest authority among his fellows, the greatest esteem among all,
  in consideration of the remission by the same Most Serene Queen at
  his prayer of a heavy sum of nearly one thousand pounds in which this
  Company was bound to the Royal Exchequer, and in consideration of
  his advancement of Surgical science, his assertion and augmentation
  of its dignity, and other brilliant services to the Surgeons, the
  Company caused this portrait to be painted after his death 1711.

Mr. Bernard possessed a valuable library containing a curious
collection of the best authors in Physic, Philology, Antiquities,
&c., together with many ancient manuscripts, all of which were sold
by Auction in March, 1711, at the Black Boy Coffee House in Ave Maria
Lane. Swift in his Journal to Stella, March 19th, says,

  I went to-day to see poor Charles Bernard’s books, and I itch to lay
  out nine or ten pounds for some fine Editions of fine authors * * *
  I walked to-day into the City, and went to see the auction of poor
  Charles Bernard’s books. They were in the middle of Physic books, so
  I bought none, and they are so dear I believe I shall buy none.

A catalogue of these books is in the Sloane collection (1770).

In Nichols’ Literary Anecdotes is a story of Mr. Edward Thwaites, M.A.,
Fellow of Queen’s College, Oxford, which characteristically introduces
Mr. Bernard.

Mr. Bernard’s daughter Elizabeth was married to Ambrose Dickins,
Esquire (who was Master in 1629 and Serjeant-Surgeon).

By his Will, dated 7th November, 1707, he bequeathed to his wife Susan,
£500 and his houses in Broad Street, Pissing Alley and Milk Street.
To his daughter Susan £1,000, and other bequests to his daughters
Elizabeth and Mary, his son Charles and his sister Jane. He desires to
be buried privately and late at night, makes his children residuary
legatees and appoints his brother, Dr. William Bernard and his kinsman,
Thomas Sisson, executors. By a codicil 3rd October, 1710, he revokes
the appointment of executors and makes his son, Henry Bernard, and
Charles Bernard (Clerk of the Barber-Surgeons) his executors with £100
each.

of Sir John Ward.

CLAUDIUS AMYAND, F.R.S., SERJEANT-SURGEON.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

CLAUDIUS AMYAND was the second son of Isaac Amyand, of Mornac,
Xaintonge, a Hugenot refugee who was naturalized in London 10th
October, 1688, and was living there in 1699. Claudius Amyand’s birth
is not recorded. He was elected a Director of the French Protestant
Hospital (La Providence) 2nd January, 1723. He was also a Fellow of
the Royal Society and Serjeant-Surgeon to George II. On 7th May, 1728,
he was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons, examined and
approved touching his skill in surgery, admitted to fine for all
offices to the Parlour door, and elected on to the Court of Assistants.
It was ordered on the same day “in regard to the dignity of their
offices” that Mr. Serjeant Dickins and Mr. Serjeant Amyand should
hereafter take precedence next after the Governors for the time being.
Mr. Amyand served as Warden in 1729 and 1730 and was Master of the
Company in 1731. He was Surgeon to St. George’s Hospital 1733-1738.
By his wife, Mary Rabache, he had three sons and six daughters. The
eldest son Claudius was Under-Secretary of State in 1750 and an M.P.;
he married Frances widow of George, 6th Earl of Northampton. The second
son George who was also an M.P. and a Director of the East India
Company was on the 4th August, 1764, created a baronet. The third
son Thomas was in holy orders. The eldest daughter Anne married John
Porter, M.P., Alderman and Sheriff of London; another daughter, Mary
Catherine married Sir Richard Adams, Recorder of London and a Baron of
the Exchequer; and the youngest daughter Judith, was married to the
Rev. Thos. Ashton, D.D., Rector of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate.

Sir George Amyand (son of Claudius) was succeeded by his eldest son,
Sir George Cornewall, Bart., M.P., who on his marriage with Catherine
daughter and heiress of Velters Cornewall, M.P., assumed the name and
arms of Cornewall and was the ancestor of the present baronet of that
name. Sir George Amyand’s second son John Amyand, M.P., died in 1780
unmarried; his daughter Anna Maria married Gilbert, Earl of Minto, and
another daughter, Harriet Mary, married James, Earl of Malmesbury.

Serjeant-Surgeon Amyand died at his house in Castle Street, St.
Martin’s-in-the-Fields, 6th July, 1740, having met with an accident in
Greenwich Park on the day previously, and his Will was proved a few
days afterwards. He bequeathed to each of his children £1,000, he left
£300 for apprenticing poor boys, and his lands in Hampshire and at
Sidlesham, Sussex, and the residue to his wife Mary.

Sir _Thomas_ was the son of Thomas Challoner, of Woodbridge, Suffolk.
On 4th July, 1699, he was apprenticed to January Farmer (who was a
Barber by trade), and was admitted to the freedom 4th March, 1707.
He left the trade of a Barber and became a Wholesale Grocer and
Merchant in Leadenhall Street, where he traded in partnership with
Mr. Lethieullier. On the 2nd December, 1760, he was elected Alderman
of the Ward of Aldgate, served the office of Sheriff in 1762 (when
the celebrated William Beckford was Lord Mayor), and was knighted 4th
October in the same year. In 1761, he was Master of the Barbers and
living at Walthamstow, where dying 8th May, 1766, he was buried there.

By his Will dated 5th March, 1766, he gave his sister Rachel Challoner
£20 per annum for life. To Mr. William Lethieullier and Rachel his
wife £100 each, and to their daughters Rachael and Margaret £50 each.

WILLIAM CHESELDEN, F.R.S.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

THIS eminent Surgeon was the son of George Cheselden, and born 19th
October, 1688, at Somerby, near Burrow-on-the-Hill, Leicestershire.
He was at an early age studying anatomy with William Cowper, the
celebrated anatomist, but appears to have left him when fifteen years
old, for on the 7th December, 1703, he was bound apprentice for seven
years to James Ferne, the Surgeon to St. Thomas’ Hospital, under
which distinguished man he made rapid advance in his profession. On
5th December, 1710, he was admitted to the freedom and livery of
the Barber-Surgeons, on the 29th January following he had a full
certificate to practise as a Surgeon, and he then (being but twenty-two
years of age) began his lectures on anatomy, and the following year was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

By a minute in our books of 25th March, 1714, it seems that Mr.
Cheselden had often procured the bodies of malefactors and privately
dissected them at his own house, and that at times when lectures and
dissections were proceeding at the Hall, whereby the attendance at the
Hall was diminished, and moreover contrary to the express laws of the
Company; whereupon he was summoned before the Court and reproved, when
he promised not to offend again in like manner. A less influential man
would probably have been fined.

In 1719 he was elected Surgeon to St. Thomas’ Hospital, where he highly
distinguished himself in his operations for the stone. He was also
consulting Surgeon to St. George’s and the Westminster Infirmary. In
1727 he was appointed principal Surgeon to Queen Caroline, and ten
years later was chosen Head Surgeon to Chelsea Hospital, which post he
held till his death. He married Miss Deborah Knight of London, by whom
he had an only daughter. His practice was both extensive and lucrative,
and his works on Surgery are numerous, besides which he was a frequent
contributor to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Mr.
Cheselden died at Bath on the 10th April, 1752.

Dr. J. F. Payne says that he will always be regarded as, beyond
dispute, one of the greatest of British surgeons, being one of the most
brilliant operators whose achievements are upon record; he was a keen
patron of athletic sports, especially boxing; his disposition was gay
and genial, he was fond of society, and evidently popular, while to his
patients he was always kind and tender-hearted.

On the separation of the Surgeons from the Barbers in 1745, Mr.
Cheselden was named in the Act of Parliament one of the Wardens of
the new Company of Surgeons, he having been Junior Warden of the
Barber-Surgeons that year. His will is a remarkable specimen of brevity
and absence of formality:--

  Being in perfect health I write this with my own hand and declare
  it to be my last Will and Testament. I give to my daughter W. J.
  Cotes five hundred pounds and all the rest and residue of my estate
  of what kind soever to my wife and make her full and sole Executrix
  administratrix and assign Witness my hand and seal. Will{m} Cheselden

AMBROSE DICKINS, SERJEANT-SURGEON.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

AMBROSE DICKINS (sometimes spelt Dickens) was the son of George Dickins
of Riplington, in East Meon, Hampshire, gentleman, and was probably
born about 1687. On the 17th February, 1702, he was apprenticed to
Serjeant-Surgeon Charles Bernard for seven years, and on the 16th
February, 1709, he was admitted to the Freedom and Livery of the
Barber-Surgeons, when he was residing in James Street, Covent Garden.
He married (before the 24th March, 1709) Elizabeth, daughter of Charles
Bernard. On December 20th, 1721, he was elected Surgeon to Westminster
Hospital. His old master, Charles Bernard, died in October, 1710, and
it seems that Dickins succeeded him when quite a young man in the
important office of Serjeant-Surgeon. In 1728 he was Warden of the
Barber-Surgeons, and in 1729 Master of the Company. He was Surgeon
to St. George’s Hospital 1733-38. On the separation of the Surgeons
from the Barbers in 1745, Mr. Dickins became an Assistant of the
Surgeons’ Company and an Examiner of Surgeons. He probably died in
1747, as on 7th September in that year Mr. Cæsar Hawkins was appointed
Serjeant-Surgeon in his place.

Dr. John Douglas, Bishop of Salisbury, in “The Criterion,” introduces
Mr. Dickins’ name in an interesting paragraph. Dr. Douglas was a firm
believer in the efficacy of the Royal touch for the King’s evil, and
he gives some curious particulars of Mr. Dickins’ experience in this
matter which are well worth referring to.

SIR CÆSAR HAWKINS, BART., SERJEANT-SURGEON.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

THIS eminent Surgeon (the son of Mr. Cæsar Hawkins, a Surgeon at
Ludlow, Shropshire) was born 10th January, 1711, and by his great
ability, at a very early age secured a large and lucrative practice;
he was the inventor of the cutting gorget, and a remarkably dexterous
operator.

  1st July, 1735. M{r} Cæsar Hawkins Surgeon in Bloomsbury who had
  lived several years with his father a Surgeon in the Country and
  afterwards with M{r} Ranby a Foreign Brother of the Company seven
  years, but not bound an Apprentice at the Hall, was in consideration
  thereof, admitted into the freedom of the Company for six pounds six
  shillings which he paid down and was sworne. At the same time the
  said M{r} Cæsar Hawkins was examined touching his skill in Surgery
  his answers were approved of and he was ordered the Diploma under the
  hands of the Governors and the seal of the Company testifying his
  skill and impowering him to practice.

19th August, 1736. Mr. Hawkins was admitted to the Livery, and the same
day was chosen a Demonstrator of Anatomy, being then but twenty-five
years of age.

  18th August, 1737. M{r} Cæsar Hawkins one of the Demonstrators of
  Anatomy attended at this Court and surrendered the said office and
  after returning this Court his thanks for the honor they had done
  him to choose him one of their Demonstrators acquainted them that he
  being appointed Surgeon to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,
  and also Surgeon to one of the troops of Guards, could not perform
  the office of a Demonstrator and therefore the Court accepted of such
  surrender.

Mr. Hawkins, in addition to his other appointments, was Surgeon to
St. George’s Hospital, 1735-1774, and Serjeant-Surgeon to George III,
to which latter office he was appointed 7th September, 1747. By his
practice as a phlebotomist alone he is said to have made £1,000 a
year, it then being the custom for people to be bled at the spring and
fall of the year.

His family have been Surgeons for some generations, and have held
distinguished office, his brother Pennell Hawkins, his son Charles,
and his grandson Cæsar Henry, having all been Serjeant-Surgeons. On
the 25th July, 1778, Mr. Hawkins was created a Baronet; he died 13th
February, 1786. A portrait of him, by Hogarth, is in the Hall of the
Royal College of Surgeons.

WALTER HENRY WILKIN, ALDERMAN.

[Illustration: Coat of Arms]

WALTER HENRY WILKIN, Esquire, who was born 1st April, 1842, is the son
of the late Mr. David Wilkin, of the firm of Wilkin and Pugh. He was
admitted to the freedom and livery of the Company 5th January, 1864.
Mr. Wilkin commenced his career as articled clerk to a well-known
firm of underwriters at Lloyds, but subsequently entered himself at
the Middle Temple, where he read with Mr. Crump, Q.C., and passing
his examination and obtaining the Certificate of the Council of Legal
Education, he was called to the Bar; but in consequence of the deaths
of his father and brother, he retired from the profession of the law to
take upon himself the conduct of their business in the City. In 1878
Mr. Wilkin was chosen an Assistant of this Company, and in 1885 served
the office of Master. For twelve years he sat as one of the Common
Council for the Ward of Lime Street. On the death of Sir Robert Walter
Carden, Mr. Alderman Cotton was transferred from Lime Street to Bridge
Without, and the vacancy thus occasioned in the Court of Aldermen, was
filled up by the appointment of Mr. Wilkin in February, 1888. He is a
member of the Court of Assistants of the Broderers’ Company, and has
filled the office of G.S. and Master in Grand Master’s Lodge No. 1.
For twenty-six years Mr. Wilkin was a Volunteer, rising to the rank of
Lieut.-Colonel in the 3rd Middlesex Artillery, but has now resigned his
commission.

(TRANSLATION.)

GUILD IN THE CITY OF LINCOLN.

  THE CERTIFICATE of the ordinances and beginning of the Fraternity
  of Barbers of Lincoln, by virtue of the proclamation in that behalf
  made, follows in these words;--

  THIS is a certain fraternity made and begun by the common assent of
  all the Barbers of the City of Lincoln, in honour of our Lord Jesus
  Christ and the Blessed Mary and observed in honour of Saint John the
  Evangelist, renewed in the feast of the Nativity of our Lord, A.D.
  1369.

  THE FIRST ordinance is, that they have and keep one “quadrate” of wax
  burning on all feast days throughout the year, and on other special
  occasions before the altar of Saint John the Evangelist in the
  Monastery of the Blessed Mary at Lincoln. And all the brothers and
  sisters of the said fraternity go in procession with the said candle,
  and all the brothers and sisters offer at the Image of Saint Saviour
  a halfpenny, under a penalty of one pound of wax.

  THE SECOND ordinance is, that if any brother or sister of this
  fraternity shall die in the City, the Dean of this guild shall bear
  in order four “soule candels,” which shall burn about the corpse
  at the Dirige and remain until the Mass. And all the brothers and
  sisters, for the soul of the departed, pay a halfpenny to the poor,
  according to the directions of the Graceman and Wardens, wherever the
  greater necessity shall be.

  THE THIRD ordinance is, that if any brother or sister shall die so
  poor, that he has not whence to be buried as he ought to be, the
  Graceman and Wardens, of the halfpennies collected, together with any
  portion of his chattels they find, shall make a general mourning, and
  do other necessaries that he be honorably buried.

  THE FOURTH ordinance is, that if any brother or sister of this
  fraternity shall desire to go into the country (_i.e._, reside out of
  the City), he shall give to the sustentation of the aforesaid candle
  at his going 2_s._, twopence to the tankards (_ad ciphos_), 1_d._ to
  the Dean of the guild, and afterwards 6_d._ annually, which he shall
  pay in three “mornspeeches”[355] in equal portions throughout the
  year.

  [355] General assemblies of the guild.

  THE FIFTH ordinance is, that if any brother or sister of this guild
  fall into poverty or sickness, so that he cannot work and prays the
  charity of this house, each brother and sister of this guild shall
  give to him 6_d._ per annum in the three mornspeeches aforesaid, by
  like equal portions.

  THE SIXTH ordinance is, that if any brother of this guild shall
  receive any apprentice to teach him his art, the same master shall
  pay for the said apprentice, to the sustentation of the said candle
  two shillings, and this at the first mornspeech after he shall have
  taken the said apprentice.

  THE SEVENTH ordinance is, that if any brother or sister of this
  guild do rebellious works or speeches, and is not willing to be
  silent but finds fault with the ruling of the Graceman of the guild,
  he shall give towards the burning of the said candle, one pound of
  wax, . . . .[356] and that without any remission; and whatsoever
  master or servant within this fraternity or out of it, shall be
  a thief to the extent of one penny, and of that matter shall be
  convicted, it is agreed by common consent that he shall abjure
  occupying his art within the City for ever.

  [356] There are two words here which I could not decipher.

  THE EIGHTH ordinance is, that none shall be admitted to any Offices
  in the said guild, unless they have been Barbers, dwelling in the
  said City; and whoever shall be elected Graceman and shall be
  unwilling to serve shall give half a stone of wax; and whoever Dean,
  and shall be unwilling, shall give one pound of wax.

  THE NINTH ordinance is, that by common assent, all the brethren shall
  have three assemblings in the year, viz.--The first, the Sunday next
  after the feast of Saint John the Evangelist aforesaid, to hear (the
  ordinances), to drink together, to settle the accounts, and to elect
  new officers for the year to come, The second, the Sunday next after
  the feast of the Apostles Philip and James, And the third, the Sunday
  next after the feast of the Translation of Saint Hugh.

  THE TENTH ordinance is, that if any brother or sister, the aforesaid
  ordinances as he is able shall not content, or shall not come when
  he shall be summoned (unless by any reasonable cause he shall be
  hindered), he shall give to the sustentation of the said candle, as
  often as he shall trespass, one pound of wax.

  AND in full confirmation of all the aforesaid ordinances, the seal of
  the Rural Dean of Lincoln is affixed to these presents in conclusion
  and testimony of the premisses. GIVEN at Lincoln the day and year
  abovesaid.

      IN LANDS and tenements to the aforesaid guild in mortmain or
      otherwise they hold nothing, nor are there any chattels in the
      hands of them the brothers and sisters to the use of the said
      guild, except out of their liberality for the sustenance of the
      aforesaid devotions; nor do they make any gatherings between
      them, unless however for the purpose of cherishing love amongst
      themselves.

  The kyng our soveraigne lord by the advise of his lordes spirytuall
  and temporall, and the commons in thys presente parlyament assembled
  and by the auctortye of the same by all their common assentes duly
  ponderyng among other things necessary for the common welth of this
  realme, that it is very expedient and nedeful to provyde for men
  experte in the science of phisicke and surgery, for the helth of
  mannes body, when infirmities and sickenes shall happen, for the
  due exercise and maintenaunce whereof good and necessary actes be
  alredy made and provided. Yet nevertheles, for as muche as within
  the citie of Londone, where men of great experience aswell in
  speculation, as in practice of the science and faculty of surgery,
  be abiding & enhabiting, and have more commonly the dayly exercise
  and experience of the same sciẽce of Surgery, then is had or used
  within any partyes of this realme: And by occasion therof many expert
  personnes be brought up under them, as their servauntes apprentices
  and others, who by thexercyse and diligent informacion of theyr sayd
  maysters, as wel now as hereafter shal exercise the sayd science
  within divers other parties of this realme, to the great relyefe
  comfort and succour of much people, and to the sure safegarde of
  theyr bodily health, theyr limittes[365] and lyves. And forasmuch
  as within the sayd citie of London there be nowe two severall and
  distincte companyes of Surgeons, occupyinge and exercisynge the
  sayde scyence and faculty of surgery, the one company being commonly
  called the Barbours of London, and the other company called the
  surgeons of London Which company of barbours be incorporated to sew
  and be sewed by the name of maisters or governours of the mistery
  and comminalty of the barbours of London, by vertue and auctoritye
  of the letters patentes under the great seale of the late kyng of
  famous memory kyng Edwarde the fourth dated at westminster the foure
  and twentie day of February in the fyrst yere of his reigne which
  afterwarde as wel by our nost[366] most drad soveraigne lord as
  by the right noble and vertuouse prynce kyng Henry the seventhe,
  father unto the kynges mooste excelent highnesse now beyng were and
  be confirmed, as by sundrie letters patentes therof made amongest
  other thynges in the same conteygned more at large maie appere. And
  the other companie called the surgeons be not incorporate, nor have
  any maner corporacion which two severall and distincte companies of
  surgeons were necessarie to bee unyted and made one bodie incorporat
  to the entente that by their unyon and often assemble togythers to
  the good and dewe order exercise and knowlage of the sayd science
  or facultie of surgerie, should be as well in speculacions as in
  practyse, both to them selves and al other their servauntes and
  apprentises, nowe and herafter to be brought up under them, and by
  their lerninge and dilegent and rype informacions more perfect spedy
  and effectuall remedy shuld be than it hath ben or should be if the
  said two companies of barbours and surgeons should contenew severed a
  sunder and not joyned togyther as they before this tyme have ben and
  used them selves not medlynge togyther. Wherfore in consyderacyon of
  the premysses be it enacted by the Kynge our soveraigne lorde, and

APPENDIX E. (_See page 157._)

THE CASE OF THE BARBERS OF LONDON.

  The _Barbers_ of _London_ were a _Fraternity_ before the Time of
  _Edward the Second_, and by Letters-Patent of _Edward the Fourth_
  were made a _Body Corporate_, and invested with several Powers and
  Privileges. In the 32d Year of _Henry the Eighth_, the _publick_
  Policy thought proper to _unite_ them with another Company (not
  then _incorporated_) called the _Surgeons_ of _London_, in order,
  (as is most probable) to _transfer_ those Powers and Privileges to
  the _latter_, without directly appearing to _wrest_ them from the
  _former_ to whom they had been _originally_ granted.

  The _Coalition_ of the two Companies having now subsisted above _Two
  Hundred Years_, the _Barbers_ are surpris’d to find an _Attempt_ made
  by the _Surgeons_ to _dissolve_ it, by Authority of _Parliament_,
  without their Participation or Consent.

  The _principal Reasons_ assigned by the _Surgeons_, in their printed
  Case, to induce the legislature to the _extraordinary_ Act of Power,
  are,

  _First_, That the _Barbers_, in the Time of _Henry the Eighth_,
  were all _Surgeons_, and that the Parliament, by _uniting_ them
  with others of _superior_ Abilities, intended _their_ Improvement
  in _that_ Profession; but that they having, long since, _ceased_ to
  intermeddle with any Branch of _Surgery_, this _Intent_ of the Act is
  frustrated, and the laudable _Purpose_ of the _Union_ at an end.

  _Secondly_, That by this _Alteration_ of the Circumstances of things,
  the Junction of the two Companies (how advantageous soever in
  _former_ Times) is _now_ become highly _inconvenient_.

  _Thirdly_, That the _Surgeons_ if _distinctly_ incorporated, would
  be encouraged to _meet_ and _communicate_ to one another their
  Experiments and Successes.

  And _Fourthly_, That the like Separation has taken place at _Paris_,
  _Edinburgh_, and _Glascow_.

  BUT the _first_ of these _Reasons_ is grounded on a _Mistake_ in
  point of _Fact_; for tho’ it be _true_ that the _Barbers_ were _all
  originally Surgeons_, and incorporated _as such_, yet long _before_
  the Union in question, _most_ of them had _quitted_ the _actual
  Exercise_ of that Profession, and the _Right_ itself of exercising
  it _in virtue_ of their Charter, had been _taken away_[373] by
  Parliament: And tho’ in the _Preamble_ of the uniting Act, _both_
  Companies are stiled _Surgeons_, yet from the _Enacting_[374] Part
  (which expresly _restrains_ the _Barbers_ from occupying any part of
  _Surgery_, except _Tooth-drawing_) it is evident the _Legislature_
  did not consider them as _real_ Surgeons, nor could intend their
  _Improvement_ in a Science they were _forbid_ to _practise_, so
  that the Circumstances of Things are _not_ altered from what they
  _then_ were, or from what they manifestly were _designed_ to be; and
  therefore the _Barbers_ having no Relation to the _Surgeons_, or
  their Art (as it was _then_ deemed no _Objection_ to their _Union_)
  cannot _now_, with any Propriety, be insisted on as a _Reason_ for
  their _Separation_.

  [373] _3 H. 8. Ch._ 11. No Person within the City of _London_, nor
  within seven Miles, shall occupy as a _Surgeon_, except he be first
  examined, approved, and admitted by the Bishop of _London_ or Dean of
  St. _Paul’s_.

  [374] _32 H. 8. Ch. 42. Sect. 3._ No Person within the City of
  _London_, Suburbs of the same, and one Mile Compass of the said City,
  using any Barbery or Shaving, shall occupy any Surgery, Letting of
  Blood, or any other Thing belonging to Surgery, Drawing of Teeth only
  except.

  With regard to the _Inconveniences_ complained of, as the Charge
  is _general_, this _general_ Answer only can be given, That the
  _Barbers_ have always, with the greatest Deference, _submitted_ to
  the _Surgeons_ in all Matters _peculiar_ to them, and chearfully
  contributed, out of their _common_ Stock, towards every Expence
  which _they_ have declared necessary for the Honour or Advancement
  of _their_ Profession. And since _none_ of these Inconveniences have
  been of Consequence enough to deserve being _particularly_ pointed
  out, we may venture to pronounce them _inconsiderable_, and unworthy
  the Attention and Redress of _Parliament_; and the rather, as _all_
  of them put together, have not prevented the _Surgeons_ of _London_
  from carrying the Improvement of their Art, both in Speculation and
  Practice, to a greater Height than has been done in any other Place
  or Nation.

  That the frequent Meetings of ingenious Men, and their free
  Communications on the Subject of their Profession, may tend _to the
  Benefit of Mankind in general, and to the Honour of their Country
  in particular_, is not denied: But surely the Constitution of the
  _united_ Company is no obstacle to these laudable Purposes. The
  _Barbers_ have for many Years, at their Monthly Courts, submitted
  to _withdraw_ at a stated Hour, and _resigned_ the Parlour to the
  Surgeons: And if this _Condescension_ is not supposed to afford
  them _sufficient_ Time for Conversation on these _particular_ Days,
  nothing _hinders_ them from holding _seperate_ Assemblies at the Hall
  almost _every_ other Day in the Year.

  As to what is said to have been done at _Paris_, _Edinburgh_, and
  _Glascow_, no _particular_ answer can be given, unless it appeared
  by what _Means_, for what _Reasons_, and upon what _Terms_ the
  _Separations_ in those Places were brought about. In _London_
  there are but two Instances of Separations of Companies, _viz._
  that of the _Feltmakers_ from the _Haberdashers_ in 1604, and that
  of the _Apothecaries_ from the _Grocers_ in 1617; but both these
  were effected by _mutual_ Consent, without the Intervention of
  _Parliament_; and it may be proper to observe, that the Feltmakers
  miscarried in a former Application for an exclusive Charter in 1576
  for _want_ of the Haberdashers Consent.

  Upon the whole, therefore, the _Barbers_ humbly hope the forgoing
  Reasons will be deemed _insufficient_ to induce the _Legislature_
  to destroy an _Union_ they _themselves_ thought proper to _form_,
  an Union which two hundred Years Existence has rendred _venerable_,
  and which, by the _Improvements_ above-mentioned, appears to have
  answered all the _Purposes_ for which it was established.

  But if for _other_ Reasons (which the _Surgeons_ say _may_ be
  given) the Parliament shall be inclined to favour them in _this
  part_ of their request; the _Barbers_, from the scrupulous Regard
  and Tenderness which that _August Assembly_ has always shewn for
  _private Property_, cannot but hope they shall be _continued_ in the
  Enjoyment of _all_ their present Possessions, without any _Division_
  whatsoever, and that, for the following Reasons:

  _First_, Because most of the _united_ Company’s Lands and Tenements,
  (particularly the Site of their _Hall, Parlour, &c._) originally
  belonged to _them_, and by the uniting Act[375] seem with great
  Justice to have been intended to remain to their _sole_ and
  _separate_ Use, tho’ in fact the _Surgeons_ have hitherto been
  _indulged_ in the _equal_ Enjoyment of them with the _Barbers_.

  [375] _32 H. 8. Ch. 42._ The united Company shall have, possess, and
  enjoy, to them and their Successors for ever, all such Lands and
  Tenements, and other Hereditaments whatsoever, which the said Company
  or Commonalty of _Barbers_ have and enjoy, _to the Use_ of the said
  Mystery and Commonalty of _Barbers_ of London.

  _Secondly_, Because the _Surgeons Share_ of what may have been
  acquired _since_ the Union, will scarce be an _adequate_ Recompence
  to the _Barbers_ for the above _Indulgence_, much less for
  the unmerited _Loss_ of a Brotherhood now so _honourable_ and
  _advantageous_ to them.

  _Thirdly_, Because the Expenses of the _Barbers_ when _distinctly_
  incorporated, can fall but very little, if any thing, short of those
  of the _united_ Company, so that a Reduction of _Income_ must subject
  them to very great Difficulties, which (considering that _they_
  neither desire, nor have given the _Surgeons_ just Cause to desire a
  Separation) would be extremely hard and unreasonable.

  _Lastly_, Because the present _flourishing_ Condition of the
  _Surgeons_, (the only _real_ Alteration in the Circumstances of
  Things) will sufficiently enable them to support the Dignity of their
  _new_ and _favourite_ Institution with becoming _Splendor_, without
  distressing their _less happy_ Brethren the _Barbers_.

The reader will find it convenient to observe the general arrangement
of this Index before using it, several references being grouped under
distinctive or separate headings.

The details of various insignificant items (_e.g._, many of the
Wardens’ payments pp. 379-422, and similar matter), together with the
Biographical Notices and Appendices (which speak for themselves),
have not been indexed. To have given a reference to _every_ sentence
would have _materially_ increased the bulk of the volume without a
corresponding advantage, but every endeavour has been made to include
whatever is practical or useful.
