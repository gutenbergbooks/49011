centuries before English spelling and punctuation became standardised;
it is presented here true to the original. It was common practice at
the time to abbreviate handwritten text using superscripted letters,

correctly with commonly used screen fonts – and on small handheld
devices they may not display at all, or may give rise to illegible
fragmented text. Readers are strongly recommended to view the text on a

Free Serif, Cardo, Segoe UI Symbol, DejaVu, Arial Unicode MS or Lucida

every browser.</p>

<p class="ti0em">In this transcription, hyperlinks (to a page,

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>



<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t.jpg" width="90" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">That</span> the foundation of the Commerce, and consequently
of the Greatness, of London was laid by the old Livery
Guilds&mdash;few will question. Much is already known,
through the Histories of such of them as have been
written&mdash;and an apology from me is not needed for a
further contribution to so interesting a study. But whilst I make
no apology for the contribution, I crave the indulgence of my readers
for any shortcomings which, from a literary point of view, may appear
in this work; I invite their attention to the matter, rather than to the
style in which it is expressed.</p>

<p>About eight years ago I applied to our Court for permission to
search the Records, and my request being complied with, I devoted such
spare time as I could secure from an engrossing occupation to the compilation
of these Annals. The work has necessarily led to the burning
of much midnight oil, because every extract and every line has been
made <i>by my own pen</i>. The researches have extended to the examination
of all, and the transcript of a considerable portion of thirteen
lengthy Charters and sets of By-laws, as also to the entire perusal of
about a hundred books of Records. In addition to this, there has been
much labour expended at the British Museum, the Public Record
Office, the Guildhall, and Somerset House.</p>

<p>The material thus collected became so voluminous, that I
experienced considerable difficulty in separating it into Subject
Chapters, and also in deciding what to retain and what to reject; my<span class="pagenum" title="iv"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a></span>
endeavour in this respect having been to preserve all that is really
interesting and curious, discarding dry legal passages, doubtful points,
and wearisome repetitions.</p>

<p>None but those who have had experience of the crabbed
eccentric writing and contractions of former times (see some of the
<i>fac-similes</i> given) and of the abbreviated “Court hand” Latin in which
Charters and other Records were penned, can have the least idea of
the trouble and care required in their deciphering; but in this respect
I have not spared pains in giving literal and accurate transcripts.</p>

<p>In no case have I modernized the old spelling, or interfered with
the quaintness of the original expressions; though all dates occurring
between the 1st January and 24th March prior to the year 1752 (when
“old style” was extinguished) have been rectified, and the “historical
year,” according to our present computation, given; thus rendering the
chronology systematic, and avoiding confusion and inaccuracy.</p>

<p>It is a matter of the greatest regret, that whilst we possess some
earlier records, our Court Minutes previous to 1551 are lost. It is conjectured
that they must have been at the Hall in 1793 (as a partial list
of Masters was then compiled), but all trace of them has now disappeared.
Again, the Minutes from 1651–1689 are now missing, although they
were at the Hall about forty years ago.</p>

<p>I may here take the opportunity to remark that the Barbers and
Barber-Surgeons held a somewhat distinctive position apart from other
Companies, inasmuch as they were a Professional rather than a Trade
Guild, and their History, consequently, becomes invested with an especial
interest. Another point to which I, as a Barber, am proud to refer is
that our Company stood out, alone, as the pioneer of Technical
Education, hundreds of years before it became as popular as it now is.
From the middle of the fifteenth century the Company was careful to<span class="pagenum" title="v"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a></span>
provide for Surgical Lectures, and the regular and systematic instruction
of its members. The means originally employed may have been
primitive, but they were dictated by high motives, and gradually
extended and developed; a Museum (a poor one, it is true) and a
valuable Library were founded, an Anatomical Theatre was built, and
every opportunity taken to encourage the Scientific study of Surgery&mdash;all
with results fraught with the greatest benefit, not only to London,
but to the Kingdom at large.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I desire to express my thanks to those who have
aided me in my work, and especially to my dear and valued friend,
Past Master Charles John Shoppee, whose practical assistance, advice
and encouragement all through, have been to me of the greatest service.
Mr. D’Arcy Power, M.A., has laid me under much obligation, and
particularly for revising and perfecting my translation of the Norman-French
Ordinances, 12th Rich. II. My son, Austin Travers Young,
has rendered valuable assistance in delineating the several Illustrations
throughout the work, and lastly, I must record, with gratitude, my
obligation to Mr. Edward Lawless for the attention and care bestowed
upon me on the numerous occasions of my visits to the Hall.</p>

<p>The preparation of this work, a somewhat arduous task for an
Amateur, has been to me purely a labour of love, and, in laying down
my pen I may be permitted to add, that my best wishes for the Ancient
Mystery of Barbers are summed up in the words of our time-honoured
toast, “<i>The Worshipful Company of Barbers, Root and Branch, and
may it flourish for ever</i>.”</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL ACCOUNT</h2>


<h3>THE BARBERS UNINCORPORATE.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t.jpg" width="90" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">The</span> origin of the Barbers’ Guild partook of a religious
character; and the meeting together of men of the
craft for religious observances, for attending the
funerals and obits of deceased members and their
wives, and for feasting once a year, gradually transformed
a semi-social and religious guild into what
ultimately became a purely secular or “trade guild.” This religious
origin is borne out by the very important Return made by the Barbers
of London, to the Writ of 12th Rich. II, and is strengthened by
reference to the Returns made by the Barbers of Lincoln and of
Norwich (both which latter are preserved at the Record Office),
and which clearly point to those guilds being of a religious character;
indeed the Barbers of Norwich do not seem to have had a single
secular or trade ordinance in their constitution.</p>

<p>1388. In the Return of the Barbers of London to the Writ of
Richard II, the Masters recite that they “have found a document
amongst the articles of their records made of the time to which
<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>memory runneth not,” concerning the points upon which the fraternity
was founded;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Primerement</span> al honourance de Dieu et touz ses Seyntes et pur excitac͠on les
c͠oens des gentz a bien faire et perseverance avoir et bien faitz.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Firstly</span> to the honour of God and all his Saints, and to stir up the commons of
the people to do well, and to have perseverance in well doing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p></div>

<p>Regulations were made enjoining charity, attendance at funerals
and obits, against the enticing away of the servants of others, providing
for the amicable settlement of disputes, and the like.</p>

<p>The articles above briefly referred to, contain nothing in
particular as to trade regulation or inspection, leaving a pretty certain
inference that they were made for the governance of a social and
religious guild or fraternity. We shall presently see that in 1308, the
Company partook of the nature of a trade guild, and we may therefore
reasonably presume that the articles made in the time to which
memory in 1388 did not run, were drawn up <i>previous</i> to 1308, and
therefore without much hesitation we may assign the origin of the
Barbers’ Company to at least the xiij<sup>th.</sup> century.</p>

<p>In the early part of the reign of Edward II, and indeed for a
long while previously, the Barbers were practitioners in the art of
Surgery; at all events they performed the minor operations of that
craft, such as bleeding, tooth-drawing, cauterization, and the like.</p>

<p>The Barbers having been accustomed to assist the monks in the
surgical operations performed by them in early times, acquired a degree
of proficiency which enabled them to practise as Surgeons themselves.
Up till about the xij<sup>th.</sup> century the practice of Surgery and Medicine
was however almost wholly confined to the Clergy, who seem to have
enjoyed the double privilege of curing men’s bodies as well as their
souls. In 1163 the Council of Tours, under Pope Alexander III,<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
considering that a practice which involved in its operations the
shedding of blood, was incompatible with the holy office of the clergy,
forbad them to interfere in any matter of Surgery; the consequence of
this edict was that they gave over the operations of Surgery but
continued to practise the healing art of Medicine.</p>

<p>As already said, the Clergy very frequently employed the
Barbers as their assistants, and committed to them the preparation of
the medicated baths and the performance of sundry minor surgical
operations. No doubt the Edict of Tours was hailed with joy by the
Barbers, who thus found a lucrative practice thrown in their way, and
seized the opportunity of practising as Surgeons “on their own
account,” calling themselves Barber-Surgeons, and practising both
Barbery and Surgery.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 1307. The archives preserved at the Guildhall have many
entries concerning the Barbers’ Company, and in <i>Letter-Book D.</i> 157<sup>B.</sup>
there is an ordinance concerning the Barbers of London, which shows
that at this time they were occupied in Surgery, and advertised their
profession in an objectionable manner, which was very properly
forbidden by the City authorities.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">De Barbours.</span> Et que nul barbier ne soit se ose ne si hardy qil mette sank
en leur fenestres en apiert ou en view des gentz, mais pryvement le facent porter a
Thamise sur peine des doux souldz rendre al oeps des Viscountz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concerning Barbers.</span> And that no barbers shall be so bold or so hardy as
to put blood in their windows, openly or in view of folks, but let them have it privily
carried unto the Thames, under pain of paying two shillings to the use of the Sheriffs.</p></div>

<p>1308. The first express entry which we have concerning our
Company is the presentation and admission of Richard le Barber, as
Supervisor or Master of the Barbers, before the Court of Aldermen
in 1308 (<i>Letter-Book C.</i> 96).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ric’s le Barbour</span> ex oppõito ecc̃lie omñi scoꝜ  parue elect’ est et p’sentatˀ pˀ

<p><span class="smcap">Richard le Barbour</span> dwelling opposite to the Church of Allhallows the Less,
was chosen and presented by the Barbers of London, on Tuesday next after the feast
of Saint Lucy the Virgin (<i>13th December</i>) in the second year of the reign of King Edward,
son of King Edward, before Sir Nicholas de Farndon, then Mayor of London, John
de Wengrave and other Aldermen, to have supervision over the trade of the Barbers &amp;c.
And he was admitted and made oath that every month he would make scrutiny throughout
the whole of his trade, and if he should find any among them keeping brothels, or acting
unseemly in any other way, and to the scandal of the trade, he was to distrain upon
them, and cause the distress to be taken into the Chamber (<i>of London</i>) &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The foregoing record does not appear very creditable to the
reputation of the Barbers of Edward the Second’s time, but it should
be remembered that in those days, and for a long period before and
afterwards, the Barbers superintended the Baths (Bagnios) and that
these places were not infrequently the resort of improper characters; a
few of our predecessors had perhaps, under the circumstances, been
somewhat lax in their morality, and let us hope that Richard le Barber
administered to those whom he found offending, due correction
according to his oath and their deserts.</p>

<p>It would not seem from the terms of the admission, that the
Master was at that period elected annually, and the Office was probably
held by one man for a considerable number of years. There is no
entry in the City books (which have been carefully examined for the
purpose) of another admission to the Office until the year 1376, when
two Masters were appointed, and then for some years subsequently two
new Masters were sworn in annually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span></p>

<p>1309. In this year we find the first record of an admission of
a Barber to the freedom of the City, and several others occur about
this period (<i>see</i> <a href="#FREEMEN">Freemen</a>).</p>

<p>1310. On Wednesday next after the feast of the Nativity,
4th Edward II, Gerard the Barber was sworn keeper of the Gate of
Newgate (<i>Letter-Book D.</i> 113), and there are other entries of Barbers
being appointed keepers or porters at the City gates; from one of
these, in 1375, it would seem that they were to keep a strict watch
that no lepers should enter the city, and it was doubtless on account
of their surgical knowledge enabling them to distinguish those afflicted
with leprosy, that these offices were conferred upon them.</p>

<p>1310. On Monday before the feast of St. Gregory the will of
Richard le Barber, our first Master, was proved in the Court of
Husting. To Katherine his wife and Johanna his daughter, he left
tenements and rents in Bread Street, Cordwainer Street, Queenhithe,
Candlewike Street, and Whitecrouche Street. To Thomas de
Mangrave his apprentice, a shop in Bread Street; to the fabric of
London Bridge 20<sup>s.,</sup> and the residue to pious uses.</p>

<p>1312. The earliest admission of a Surgeon (<i>not</i> a Barber
Surgeon) to the freedom is that of “Magister Johẽs de Suthwerk
cirurgicus,” who was sworn on Friday before the feast of St. Barnabas,
5th Edward II, and who paid nothing for his freedom, being admitted
at the instance of Hugh de Waltham, Town Clerk.</p>

<p>Among the Archives at Guildhall are various entries relating to
early Barbers, which, although not touching upon the history of our
Company, may properly be preserved in these pages, and I shall
therefore give translations of a few of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1315. On Monday next after the feast of the Purification of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, in the 8th Edward II, by common assent of the Mayor and Aldermen
in the Hustings of pleas of Land, there was granted and demised to William de
Dounesheued, Barber to Sir John de Sandale, Chancellor of our Lord the King, a certain
house belonging to the Bridge of London, to have and to hold to the said William for
his whole life, he paying yearly on the usual days two and a half marks to the keepers
for the time being of the said Bridge, which said house is situate between a house
belonging to the said Bridge in which John Mew now dwells towards the West, and
a house belonging to Thomas le Maderman towards the East, in the Parish of Saint
Dionis Backchurch London. And the said William, the said house and its appurtenances
in all needful manner shall sustain, and against wind and rain cause the same to be
defended during the whole term of his life.</p></div>

<p>And there was a proviso that if the rent should remain unpaid
for a whole year that the Bridge Keepers should re-enter. (<i>Letter-Book
E.</i> 28<sup>B.</sup>)</p>

<p>1319. On Thursday after the feast of St. Valentine, 13th
Edward II, there was enrolled an obligation by which Roger the
Barber (servant to John de Dallinge, Sheriff of London) and
Margaret his wife, were bound to pay £100 to Sir John de Laugecombe,
Rector of the Church of Laumaz Heys (<i>sic</i>) before the
feast of Easter. (<i>Letter-Book E.</i> 85.)</p>

<p>1320. On Wednesday next after the feast of Saints Fabian
and Sebastian, 13th Edward II, Lawrence the Barber, one of the
men sworn to keep the Poultry Market on Cornhill, laid an information
against John Bakon that he the said John was a forestaller
of the Market. (<i>Letter-Book E.</i> 96<sup>B.</sup>)</p>

<p>1320. In the same year among the names of the Citizens
assessed to contribute to a fine of £1,000 to the King, occurs
that of Thomas the Barber. (<i>Letter-Book E.</i> 106<sup>B.</sup>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>

<p>1320. On Monday next before the feast of St. Margaret the
Virgin, 14th Edward II, the Wardship of Alice, Joane and Agnes,
children of John de Wynton, Barber, deceased, was given to Joane his
widow; several shops and houses in the City belonging to the
deceased are scheduled as for the benefit of the Wards, and Robert
de Lamyngton, John de Bristolle, Barber, and Roger de Croidon
were bound as sureties. (<i>Letter-Book E.</i> 114.)</p>

<p>Instances also occur of City Wards (sons of Barbers deceased)
being apprenticed by the Chamberlain to various trades.</p>

<p>1340. In 14th Edward III, Hamo the Barber was assessed
by the City at £10 as his contribution towards a forced loan of
£5,000 to the King (<i>Letter-Book F.</i> 33) and six years later (1346)
Hamo was again assessed at 20<i>s.</i> towards a “present” of 3,000
marks to the King.</p>

<p>1370. On 14th March, 44th Edward III, the wardship of
Alice (aged 3 years), daughter of Nicholas the Barber, was given
to Gilbert Prince, who was to use her legacy of 40 marks for her
benefit.</p>

<p>1374. On the 28th July, 1374, Lawrence de Weston, Barber
(Master of the Company in 1376), and Margaret his wife, mother
of the said Alice, came before the Mayor, &amp;c., and proved that the
said Alice was dead, whereupon Gilbert Prince, the Executor of
Nicholas the Barber’s will, was discharged, and the money paid
to Lawrence and Margaret de Weston. (<i>Letter-Book G.</i> 244
and 317<sup>B.</sup>)</p>

<p>Reverting now from individuals to the Company, we find
that the Barbers existed as a Trade Guild, but unincorporated
certainly from the year 1308, and that they were at first ruled by<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
one Master, and later on (in 1376) by two Masters, appointed annually.
This Company of Barbers was composed of two classes of
Members&mdash;viz., those who practised Barbery proper (perhaps including
phlebotomy and tooth drawing), and those who practised
Surgery, and who were, for distinction sake, called Barber-Surgeons
(in the City books they are spoken of as “Barbers exercising the
faculty of Surgery”). For aught we know to the contrary, a perfect
harmony and good understanding existed between these two sections
of the Company, and it is probable that the ranks of the latter
were continually recruited from the former.</p>

<p>1381. The earliest evidence of the existence of our Hall is
to be found in Harl. MS. 541, which contains a list of Companies’
Halls in the City, temp. 5 Richard II, by which it appears that
the Barbers’ Hall was then, as now, in the Parish of Saint Olave,
Silver Street, and doubtless on the same site; the entry is,
“Barbar hall y<sup>e</sup> p’yssh of Seynt Oluf in Sylverstrete.” In 1490 the
Hall is <i>known</i> to have been on the same site.</p>

<p>1388. In this year Richard II sent his writs all over the
Kingdom to enquire into the nature and constitution of the several
guilds and fraternities, religions, social or craft, and the returns to
these writs, which must have been an immense number, were formerly
kept among the Records at the Tower of London. Herbert, in his
History of the Livery Companies, refers to his fruitless endeavours to
discover these returns, and I have made diligent enquiry at the Record
Office for them also, with the undoubted result that all of those which
relate to the London Trading Guilds are lost. There are, however, a
great number relating to London religious guilds and to trade guilds
all over the country. Two of these concerning the Barbers of Norwich
and of Lincoln are so highly interesting that I have preserved them in
<a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span></p>

<p>Amongst our Archives at Barbers’ Hall, is a vellum book of
Ordinances written out fair in 1658, and therein is to be found a copy
of the return made by the Barbers of London to the writ of Richard II,
and which the Company caused to be extracted from the Tower Records
in 1634. It is certified by William Colet as agreeing with the original,
but unfortunately Mr. Colet (although he was Deputy-Keeper of the
Records) or his copyist has made one or two mistakes, which necessitate
a little hiatus in the translation, and he has put the year as the 11th
instead of the 12th of Richard II. That the latter year is the correct
one is abundantly proved by the dates on the original writs and on the
numerous returns still in existence at the Record Office, as also by the
names of the Masters certifying, who are recorded at Guildhall as
having been admitted 10th September, 12th Richard II.</p>

<p>Richard II was more solicitous as to the funds and property of
the Guilds, than he was about their observances, and our predecessors
seem to have quickly acquainted him with their pecuniary position, “the
which Company have neither tenements nor rents to their common use.”</p>

<p>The Masters recite an old document which they found in their
strong box, and which will well repay perusal; it opens with a devout
dedication to the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and the glorious company
of heaven, and the first Ordinance being expressly made in honour of
God and all saints, and with the intention of stirring up the people to
do well and to persevere therein, we must all approve of it. It provides
firstly, that decayed brethren shall have an allowance of 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub><i>d.</i> per
week, if their poverty have not come about by their own folly. The
second and third Ordinances relate to attendance at funerals and obits
of deceased members. Then follow certain rules, that no man shall
entice away another’s servant; the Masters to settle disputes, payment
of quarterage, refusal of office, absence from Mass and the yearly feast,<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
the  livery clothing, &amp;c., &amp;c. It is well to observe here the evidence of
the antiquity of our livery, of the quarterage, and of the feast, all of
which have come down to these days.</p>

<p>Some later Ordinances  are added, which were apparently made
in 1387. This return is probably the only one extant of the whole of
those made by the London trade guilds, and is therefore of the highest
interest. A copy of the original (which is in Norman French), together
with a translation, follows.</p>

<span class="smcap">A Copy</span> taken from a Bundle “of the Fraternities and Guilds of the City of

<p class="ti0em">Anno 12.<br />
Richard II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Heydon</span> and Henry Cook, Masters, William Chapman and William
Gomine, Surveyors of the Company called the Fraternity of Barbers of the City of
London of ancient time established, certifying to the Council of Our Lord the King,
in his Chancery, the form manner and condition of all the articles, customs and their
circumstances contained in the Records of the same Company in the form following:&mdash;The
which Company have neither tenements nor rents to their common use, And these
articles the said Company have not used in their time excepting only for to have their
Livery once a year, and to pay their quarterage to maintain the poor folk of the same
Company, and once a year to assemble to feast, and to elect new Masters and Surveyors
without any other article of their writing to put forward except those which only
are made to the honour of God; but, however, as they have found a document
amongst the articles of the Records, made of the time to which memory runneth
not, they have presented it to your most wise discretions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This Indenture</span> made in the name of the Omnipotent God, the Father and
Son and the Holy Ghost, and of our Lady Saint Mary and of all the glorious Company
of Heaven, concerning the foundation of the Government of the Fraternity of Barbers of
the City of London Witnesseth how and upon what points the said Fraternity is
founded and ordained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Firstly</span> to the honour of God and all his Saints, and to stir up the Commons
of the people to do well, and to have perseverance in well doing, it is ordained that if
any brother of this Fraternity who has been of this Fraternity for seven years by chance
fall into trouble or into poverty, and if he have nothing of his own by which he may
be able to live, and it be not through his own folly, that then he shall have each
week from their common box tenpence half penny for his sustenance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> That when any brother of the said Fraternity dies the brethren of the
said Fraternity shall go on the Vigil to the dirge, and on the <span class="nowrap">day<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> to the Mass, and to
the dirge and to the mass of the month’s obit, and that each such brother dead have
thirty masses from their common box<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> and that each brother who is absent without
reasonable excuse at any of the said four times, shall put into their common box in place of
his offerings and expenses, as he ought to have done if he had been present, three pence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> When any Master of the said Fraternity has a wife dead, the brethren of
the said Fraternity shall be at the Vigil and at the Mass on the day of her burial and at
the month’s obit, and that brother who is absent at any of the three times shall pay for
each time that he be absent, in place of the costs and other expenses which he would have
borne if he had been present, three pence to their common box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> That no brother of the said Fraternity entice any servant from the
service of his master, privily or openly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> If any dispute arise between any of the brethren, which God forbid, it
is to be amicably settled by the decision of the Masters of the said Fraternity [<i>and they
are</i>] to deal plainly<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> and that no one sue another in other manner than at the assize (<i>?</i>)
[<i>and then only</i>] if he be empowered by leave of the said Masters to be recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> That each brother of the said Fraternity shall come each quarter of the
year and pay his quarterage to the <span class="nowrap">collectors<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> It is agreed between all the said brethren that whoever of them refuses
his office when it comes to him, if he wishes to be relieved of it, that he pay to their
common box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> If any brother be absent from their Mass and Feast when it shall be
once a year, he shall pay so much in offerings and all other things as one present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> That none of the said brethren put [?] another out of his house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> If any brother by chance delay his payments beyond a year-and-a-half,
that he make acquittance within two years without any [<i>penalty</i>] beyond the ordinary fine.
And if he be thus forgiven that he settle the matter at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> to hold these points pursuant to amendment alone if the Mystery will that
they be amended, this Fraternity are sworn among themselves and have each of them
pledged his troth, and so from each who shall [<i>hereafter</i>] be of the said Fraternity. And
it is agreed amongst them that this Indenture be enclosed in their common box, and the
counterpart be held by the Masters for the time being of the said Fraternity.</p></div>

<p>The document which the Masters found amongst their records
made in “the time to which memory runneth not” probably ends here,
and the following Items (see the third one) were doubtless additional
Ordinances made circa 1387.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> That each brother of the said Fraternity pay in pledge for his livery,
when he has the same, forty pence at the least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> That each brother keep the livery two whole years before he may give,
or sell, or alienate it in any manner, under pain of paying to the Company for their
pardon, a noble of gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> It is ordained that on the Sunday following the Assumption of our Lady
in the 11th year of King Richard the Second<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> that the Surveyors of the said Mystery be
elected by the assent of all the Fraternity, and no longer by the Masters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> That none of the said Fraternity hereafter pay more than fourteen pence
for his feast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Item.</span> It is ordained that each Master who shall choose any other man to be in
his place, that is to say for to be Master; he who shall choose such man to be Master
for the year shall be bound by himself for him, in an obligation to the Company for the
money<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span></p>

<p>Coeval with our Company of Barbers there existed in the City
of London, another Fraternity or Guild, that of the Surgeons, in no
way connected with the Barbers, but, like them, existing by prescription
only and unincorporated. It is not to be expected that these two
Companies would, in the days of so much trade protection and
jealousy, exhibit an over-friendly feeling towards one another, and the
records of the period, though meagre, show that this was the case.
The Surgeons’ Guild at no time appear to have been a numerous body,
indeed there is reason to believe that frequently their numbers were
less than a dozen, and they possibly never exceeded twenty.</p>

<p>In the researches undertaken for the purpose of this work,
various references to the Surgeons’ Guild have turned up, and although
at this early period there was much in common between the two
Fraternities, I have considered it quite apart from the subject in hand
to go into any detail concerning that Guild, more especially as it has
recently been so ably and fully dealt with by Mr. D’Arcy Power in his
“Memorials of the Craft of Surgery.”</p>

<p>1376. In the 50th Edward III, the Barbers made a complaint
to the Mayor and Aldermen against unskilled practitioners in
Surgery, and prayed that two Masters should be yearly appointed to
inspect and rule the craft, and that none should be admitted to the
freedom of the City, but upon due examination of their skill; and this
was granted by the Court, entered of record and Lawrence de Weston
and John de Grantone were chosen Masters. The following is a
translation of the original record concerning this matter<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the honourable Lords, and wise, the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of
London, shew the good folks, the Barbers of the same city, that whereas from one day to<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
another there resort men, who are barbers, from <span class="nowrap">uppelande<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> unto the said city, who are
not instructed in their craft, and do take houses and intermeddle with barbery, surgery,
and the cure of other maladies, while they know not how to do such things, nor ever were
instructed in such craft; to the great damage, and in deceit, of the people, and to the
great scandal of all the good barbers of the said city:&mdash;therefore the said good folks do
pray that it may please your honourable Lordships, for the love of God, and as a work of
charity, to ordain and establish that from henceforth no such stranger, coming to the said
City from uppelande, or from any other place, of whatsoever condition he be, shall keep
house or shop for barbery within the same city, before that he shall be found able and
skilled in the said art and office of barbery, and that, by assay and examination of the good
folks, barbers of the same city, whom out of the said craft it may please you to ordain
thereunto. And that it may please you to ordain and establish, that from henceforth
there shall always be two good men of their said craft chosen by their common assent to
be Wardens of the craft; and that such two persons shall be presented unto the Mayor,
Recorder, and Aldermen, of the said city, and sworn before them well and lawfully, to the
best of their power and knowledge, to rule their said craft; and that the said Masters may
inspect the instruments of the said art, to see that they are good and proper for the service
of the people, by reason of the great peril that might ensue thereupon; and that on the
complaint of such two Masters, all rebellious persons in the said craft, shall be made to
come before you, and whosoever shall be found in default against this Ordinance shall pay
to the Chamber 40 pence. And that from henceforth no man of their craft shall be
admitted to the franchise of the said city, if he be not attested as being good and able,
upon good examination before you made. And that no foreigner shall keep house or
shop in their craft within the said city, or the suburbs thereof. And that this Ordinance
shall be enrolled in the Chamber of the Guildhall of London, for all time to last.</p>

<p>And the same was granted unto them. Whereupon, Laurence de Westone and
John de Grantone were chosen Masters of the Barbers. [<i>Letter-Book H. 28.</i>]</p></div>

<p>The foregoing ordinance must surely have given umbrage to
the Surgeons’ Guild as it placed the Barbers upon an equal
footing with them in the examination of Surgeons, the inspection
of their instruments, etc.; and this more especially as seven years
previously (in 1369) the Surgeons had obtained from the same
Court an Ordinance investing them with the power of presenting
the defaults of all unskilful Surgeons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span></p>

<p>1382. As an example of a quack Surgeon’s method of practice,
and of his rogueries and punishment, the following case of Roger
Clerk will be found <span class="nowrap">interesting:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Roger Clerk, of Wandelesworth<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> on the 13th day of May in the 5th year
(<i>Richard II</i>), was attached in the Chamber of the Guildhall of London, before the
Mayor and Aldermen, to make answer, as well to the Mayor and Commonalty of the City
of London, as to Roger atte Hacche, in a plea of deceit and falsehood: as to which, the
same Roger said, that whereas no physician or surgeon should intermeddle with any
medicines or cures within the liberty of the city aforesaid, but those who are experienced
in the said arts, and approved therein, the said Roger Clerk, who knew nothing of either
of the arts aforesaid, being neither experienced nor approved therein, nor understood
anything of letters, came to the house of him, Roger atte Hacche, in the parish of St.
Martin, in Ismongereslane, in London, on Thursday, the morrow of Ash Wednesday, in
the 5th year, etc.; and there saw one Johanna, the wife of the aforesaid Roger atte
Hacche, who was then lying ill with certain bodily infirmities, and gave the said Roger,
her husband, to understand, that he was experienced and skilled in the art of medicine,
and could cure the same Johanna of her maladies, if her husband desired it.</p>

<p>Whereupon, the said Roger atte Hacche, trusting in his words, gave him
12 pence, in part payment of a larger sum which he was to pay him, in case the said
Johanna should be healed. And upon this, the same Roger Clerk then and there gave
to the said Roger atte Hacche an old parchment, cut or scratched across, being the leaf
of a certain book, and rolled it up in a piece of cloth of gold, asserting that it would be
very good for the fever and ailments of the said Johanna; and this parchment, so rolled
up, he put about her neck, but in no way did it profit her; and so, falsely and
maliciously, he deceived the same Roger atte Hacche. And he produced the said
parchment here in Court, wrapped up in the same cloth, in proof of the matters aforesaid.</p>

<p>And the said Roger Clerk personally appeared, and the said parchment was
shown to him by the Court, and he was asked what the virtue of such piece of parchment
was; whereupon, he said that upon it was written a good charm for fevers. Upon being
further asked by the Court what were the words of this charm of his, he said;&mdash;“Anima
Christi, sanctifica me; Corpus Christi, salva me; in isanguis Christi, nebria me; cum
bonus Christus tu, lava me.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> And the parchment being then examined, not one of<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
those words was found written thereon. And he was then further told by the Court, that
a <span class="nowrap">straw<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> beneath his foot would be of just as much avail for fevers, as this said charm of
his was; whereupon, he fully granted that it would be so. And because that the same
Roger Clerk was in no way a literate man, and seeing that on the examination aforesaid,
(as well as on others afterwards made,) he was found to be an infidel, and altogether
ignorant of the art of physic or of surgery; and to the end that the people might not be
deceived and aggrieved by such ignorant persons, etc.; it was adjudged that the same
Roger Clerk should be led through the middle of the City, with trumpets and pipes, he
riding on a horse without a saddle, the said parchment and a whetstone, for his lies, being
hung about his neck, an urinal also being hung before him, and another urinal on his
back. [<i>Letter-Book H. 145.</i>]
</p></div>

<p>1390. In connection with the Surgeons’ Guild, four Master
Surgeons of the City were sworn before the Mayor, etc., in this year,
and <i>they</i> were to make scrutiny amongst persons practising the art of
Surgery, and to present defaults. [<i>Letter-Book H.</i> 248.] It will be
remembered that in 1369 a somewhat similar Ordinance was made
for the Surgeons’ Guild, and this one in 1390 was probably obtained
as a set off to the powers vested in the Barbers by their Ordinance of
1376, and by way of assertion of equal rights with them in matters
surgical. Anyhow it is very clear that there were two distinct bodies
within the City ruling the craft of Surgery at this period, each, no
doubt, claiming jurisdiction over its own members, and both anxious
and ready to interfere with outsiders, and probably with each other.
It is curious to note that in the Ordinance of 1390, above referred to,
the Masters inspecting are authorised to make scrutiny not only of
men, but of “women undertaking cures, or practising the art of
Surgery”; and here, in the 19th century, we find history repeating
itself, and women again “intermeddling in matters surgical.”</p>

<p>As might be expected the dual scrutiny exercised over persons
practising surgery, by two distinct and antagonistic Companies,<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
produced considerable jealousy and unpleasantness, and there are
various records extant indicative of cases of attempted interference
with the Barbers’ privileges, one of which is distinctly stated to
have been the work of the Surgeons and Physicians, as doubtless
also were the others.</p>

<p>1410. By <i>Letter-Book I.</i> 94, it appears that the Ordinances for
the Barbers made in 1376 were confirmed to them with the significant
addition that they should enjoy the same, “without the scrutiny of any
person or persons of any other craft or trade, under any name whatsoever
other than the craft or trade of the said Barbers, either as to
shaving, making incision, blood letting or any other matters pertaining
to the art of Barbery or of Surgery, in the craft of the said Barbers now
practised, or to be practised hereafter.” This Ordinance is, I think,
clearly directed against the Masters of the Surgeons’ Guild, who
had sought to exercise their authority over the Barbers using the
faculty of Surgery.</p>

<p>1415. Complaint having been made to the Mayor and
Aldermen, concerning the unskilful and fraudulent practice of certain
Barbers in matters of Surgery, the privileges of the Barbers were
again recorded, though the Company who had hitherto nominated
their own Masters, were somewhat shorn of that privilege, as the
Mayor, etc., directed the names of all the Barber (Surgeons) to be
brought before them, and after due enquiry, <i>they</i> selected two of
them for Masters, and gave them their charge and oath.</p>

<p>1416. “Certain trustworthy and discreet” Barber (Surgeons)
complained to the Mayor, etc., that notwithstanding the last order,
there were still unruly members in the craft, and a fresh Ordinance
was enacted which imposed a penalty on offenders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<p>The Ordinances above referred to are to be found in <i>Letter-Book
I.</i> 149, and are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Be it remembered, that on the 10th day of April, in the 3rd year, etc. (<i>1415</i>) it
was intimated in a relation, and not without alarm, unto Thomas Fauconer, Mayor, and
the Aldermen, how that some barbers of the said city, who are inexperienced in the art
of surgery, do oftentimes take under their care many sick and maimed persons, fraudulently
obtaining possession of very many of their goods thereby; by reason whereof, they are
oftentimes made to be worse off at their departure than they were at their coming: and
that, by reason of the inexperience of the same barbers, such persons are oftentimes
maimed; to the scandal of such skilful and discreet men as practise the art of surgery,
and the manifest destruction of the people of Our Lord the King.</p>

<p>And the said Mayor and Aldermen, wishing to obviate an evil and a scandal
such as this, as also, to provide a fitting remedy for the same, and considering first, how
that the said barbers by themselves, without the scrutiny of any other persons of any other
trade or craft<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> or under any name whatsoever, have supervision and scrutiny over all men
following the craft of barbery, and within the liberty of the said city dwelling, as to all
manner of cases touching the art of barbery or the practice of surgery, within the
cognizance, or to come within the cognizance, of the craft of the said barbers;&mdash;as by a
certain Ordinance, made and ordained in the time of Richard Merlawe<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> late Mayor, and
the then Aldermen, and in the Chamber of the said City of London enrolled, of record fully
appears;&mdash;did determine and ordain that in future, by the more substantial part of all the
barbers following the practice of surgery, and dwelling within the liberty of the said city,
there should be chosen two of the most skilful, most wise, and most discreet men, of all
the barbers following such practice of surgery, and dwelling within the liberty of the said
city; seeing that oftentimes under their scrutiny and correction there would be found
cases of possible death and maiming, where, if ignorant and indiscreet men should
undertake the management thereof&mdash;the which might God forbid&mdash;in their judgment
grievous errors might unexpectedly ensue, by reason of such unskilfulness. And that
the same Masters, so often as they should be thus chosen, on election should be presented
to the Mayor and Aldermen, for the time being, there by the said Mayor and Aldermen
to be accepted and sworn etc.</p>

<p>And lest perchance a difference of opinion might in future as to such election
arise, therefore, the said Mayor and Aldermen, after taking counsel on the matter aforesaid,
on Friday, the 3rd day of May, in the same year (<i>1415</i>), caused to be brought<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
before them the name of every barber who followed the practice of surgery and dwelt
within the liberty of the said city, in order that, after enquiring into the duties and
experiences of their practice and skill, in manner theretofore approved and customary,
they might be the better able to accept such Masters. And hereupon, because that,
among other names, Simon Rolf and Richard Wellys, citizens and barbers of the said
city practising the art of surgery, as well for their knowledge and probity, as for the
different kinds of difficult cures that had been sagaciously performed and effected
by them, were by trustworthy testimony, upon sound and umblemished information,
commended before any others, precept was given by the said Mayor and Aldermen to
Baldwin Tettisbury, one of the serjeants of the said Mayor, to summon the said Simon
and Richard for Monday the 6th day of May then next ensuing, to appear before the
said Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber of the Guildhall aforesaid, there to make the
oath to them by the said Mayor and Aldermen to be administered.</p>

<p>Upon which Monday the said Simon and Richard, by virtue of such summons,
appeared before the Mayor and Aldermen in the Chamber aforesaid. And hereupon
the said Simon and Richard were then accepted by the said Mayor and Aldermen, and
sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of God, well and faithfully to watch over and oversee
all manner of barbers practising the art of surgery, and within the liberty of the said city
dwelling; to maintain and observe the rules and ordinances of the craft or practice
aforesaid; no one to spare, for love, favour, gain, or hate; diligently without concealment
to present unto the Chamberlain of the said City, for the time being, such defaults as
they may find; at all times, when duly required thereto, well and faithfully to examine
wounds, bruises, hurts, and other infirmities, without asking anything for their trouble;
and what they should find, at their discretion, when duly required thereto, distinctly to
certify unto the Mayor and Aldermen of the said City, for the time being; as also, well
and faithfully to conduct themselves from thenceforth in future; and all other things to
do and perform, which of right are befitting or requisite for the masters or overseers of
such practice to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Afterwards</span>, on the fourth day of July, in the 4th year, etc. (<i>1416</i>) before
Nicholas Wottone, Mayor, the Recorder, and the Aldermen, in full Court, upon truthful
information of certain trustworthy and discreet men of the craft of Barbers, practising the
art of surgery aforesaid, as of other able and substantial men of the said city, it was stated
how that, notwithstanding the Ordinance aforesaid, very many inexperienced men of the
said craft of Barbers, indiscreetly practising the art of surgery, did presume, and in their
presumption pretend, that they were wiser than the Masters inspecting, and, as to certain
infirmities&mdash;indiscreetly excusing themselves therein, on the insufficient grounds that they<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
are not liable to the peril of maiming or of death&mdash;did altogether disdain to give notice
of the same to the said Masters inspecting, according to the Ordinance aforesaid, or to
be discreetly examined by them as to the same, or diligently to be questioned thereon.
Upon which pretence, they did not hesitate daily to take sick persons, in peril of death
and of maiming, under their care, without shewing such sick persons, or such infirmities
and perils, unto the same Masters inspecting; by reason of which presumption or
unskilfulness, such sick persons were exposed to the greatest peril, either of maiming or
of death. Wherefore, the said Mayor and Aldermen were prayed that, for the common
advantage of the whole realm, and the especial honour of the said city, they would deign
to provide some sure remedy for the same.</p>

<p>And accordingly, the Mayor and Aldermen, assenting to the said petition, as
being just and consistent with reason, having taken diligent counsel as to the matters
aforesaid, and considering that very many of such persons in these times are more in
dread of loss or payment of money than amenable to the dictates of honesty or a safe
conscience, did ordain and enact, that no barber, practising the art of surgery within the
liberty of the said City, should presume in future to take under his care any sick person
who is in peril of death or of maiming, unless he should show the same person, within
three days after so taking him under his care, to the Masters inspecting, for the time
being, by the barbers practising the art of surgery within the liberty of the said City to
be elected, and to the Mayor and Aldermen presented, and by them specially to be
admitted; under a penalty of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the Chamber of London in form underwritten to
be paid, so often as, and when, against this Ordinance they should be found to act;
namely, 5 shillings to the use of the Chamber of the Guildhall, and 20 pence to the use
of the craft of the Barbers.</p></div>

<p>1423. In this year certain Ordinances were made by the
Mayor (Sir William Walderne) and Court of Aldermen which are
entered in <i>Letter-Book K.</i> 6<sup>B.</sup> This record relates to what Mr. D’Arcy
Power, in his “Memorials of the Craft of Surgery,” has termed a
“Conjoint College” of the Physicians and Surgeons, and has little
to do with our Company, beyond the fact that the scrutiny
and oversight of persons practising Surgery is given to the
Masters of the Surgeons’ Guild. The subject of these Ordinances
and many very interesting remarks thereon and on the Conjoint
College may be seen at p.&nbsp;52, &amp;c., of Mr. D’Arcy Power’s work;<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
and the record itself is set forth in full at p.&nbsp;299; furthermore,
extracts from it, so far as the same relate to the privileges and
practice of the Surgeons, are to be found in the beautiful old
vellum MS. formerly belonging to that Guild, and now in the
possession of the Barbers’ Company.</p>

<p>Armed with this additional authority, the Surgeons’ Guild
again sought to interfere with and scrutinize the Barber-Surgeons
of the Barbers’ Company. These latter, however, must have had
good friends at Court, and were not slow in asserting and obtaining
confirmation of their rights and privileges, as will be seen by
reference to the following record in <i>Letter-Book K.</i> 27<sup>B.</sup><span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1424. <span class="smcap">Memorandum.</span> That on Friday the 10th day of November in the third year
of the reign of Henry the Sixth from the Conquest before John Michell, Mayor, Thomas
Knolles and other Aldermen, and Simon Seman and John Bithewater, Sheriffs of the
City of London, It was granted and ordained that the Masters of the faculty of Surgery
within the craft of Barbers of the same city, do exercise the same faculty even as fully
and entirely as in the times of Thomas Fauconer late Mayor, and other Mayors, it was
granted unto them, notwithstanding the false accusation (<i>calumpnia</i>) which the Rector
and Supervisors of Physic and the Masters of Surgery pretend concerning a certain
ordinance made in the time of William Walderne late Mayor (<i>1423</i>) and entered in the
letter book K, folio 6, the which, they now endeavour to enjoin upon the said Barbers.</p></div>

<p>1451. With the exception of a few references (which are
noticed elsewhere) the City records are silent concerning the
Barbers’ Company until this year, when the Master and Wardens,
styled here “Gardiani,” with certain honest men of the Mystery of
Barbers, brought a Bill before the Mayor and Aldermen, praying
them to establish certain Ordinances, and to enter them of record,
which was granted and done.</p>

<p>These Ordinances provided for the enforcement of stated
penalties in cases of disobedience and related to attendance upon<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
summons, settlements of disputes, refusal of office, admission of
members, evil speaking, assemblies and payments, instruction of
“foreyns,” employment of aliens. They are to be found in
<i>Letter-Book K.</i> 250, and are the first written in English, all
previous ones being either in Latin or Norman French in the
originals.</p>

<p>Nothing is now heard of the Surgeons’ Guild for some
years, although they were still in existence. It is quite probable,
that finding the Barbers had invariably obtained the protection and
countenance of the City authorities, whenever their privileges had
been assailed or called in question, they had given over their attempts
at interference with them as hopeless, and allowed our worthy
predecessors to continue to “exercise the faculty of surgery,” in
peace; and being unmolested they doubtless grew in numbers, in
importance, and in the knowledge of their art, until it was
admitted that their position as one of the Guilds, warranted them
in applying for a Charter of Incorporation, which was granted to
them by Edward IV in 1462.</p>

<p>1413. Before proceeding to refer to this important epoch
in the history of our Company, it will be well to introduce a very<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
remarkable letter, which was written by Thomas Arundell, Archbishop
of Canterbury (formerly of York), to the Mayor, etc., of
London, in which he complained that the Barbers, being, alas!
“without zeal for the law of God,” kept their shops open on the
Sabbath days, and he besought the Mayor and Aldermen (his “sons
in Christ, and dearest friends”) to put a stop to this practice. No
trade, perhaps, has from the earliest days, down to our own times,
owned such persistent breakers of the Fourth Commandment as
have the Barbers. Our records abound with by-laws, enacted and
renewed over and over again on this subject, and details of the
delinquencies of numerous Barbers in this respect, and of their
punishments by fine and imprisonment crop up everywhere.</p>

<p>The Archbishop’s letter reveals to us the fact, that nearly
500 years ago, men were constituted much as they are now; in
that “that which touches the body or the purse, is held more in
dread than that which kills the soul,” and he shrewdly suggests that
the clerical punishment of “the greater excommunication,” should be
augmented by a fine to be levied by the Civil authority. This letter
is so deeply interesting that no apology is needed for reproducing it
here. The original is to be found in <i>Letter-Book I.</i> 125.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1413. On the 24th day of July, in the first year, etc. (Henry V) the Reverend
Father in Christ, and Lord, Thomas, by Divine permission, Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, Primate of all England, and Legate of the Apostolic See, sent here, to the
Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London, certain Letters Close of his, containing
words as <span class="nowrap">follow:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sons in Christ and dearest friends.&mdash;We know that you do seek for the things
which are of above, and that you will the more readily incline to our desires, the more
surely that the things as to which we write are known to tend to the observance of the
Divine law, the maintenance of public propriety, and the rule of the Christian profession.
We do therefore write unto you on this occasion, to intimate that when we were
presiding of late in our Provincial Council, holden at London, with our venerable<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
brethren, the Suffragan Bishops, and our clergy of the Province of Canterbury, it was
publicly made known unto us with universal reprobation, that the Barbers of the City
of London, over the governance of which city you preside, being without zeal for the
law of God, and not perceiving how that the Lord hath blessed the seventh day and
made it holy, and hath commanded that it shall be observed by no abusive pursuit of
any servile occupations, but rather by a disuse thereof, in their blindness do keep their
houses and shops patent and open on the seventh day, the Lord’s Day, namely, and do
follow their craft on the same, just as busily, and just in the same way, as on any day in
the week, customary for such work. Wherefore we, with the consent and assent of our
said Suffragans and clergy, in restraint of such temerity as this, have determined that
there must be made solemn prohibition thereof in the City aforesaid, and that, of our
own authority, and that of our said Provincial Council; and not there only, but also
throughout the Diocese of London, and each of the cities both of our own Diocese and
of our Province of Canterbury; to the effect, that such barbers must not keep their
houses and shops patent or open, or follow their craft, on such Lord’s Days for the
future, on pain of the greater excommunication; in the same manner as it has been
enacted and observed of late in our time, as to the City and Diocese of York, as we do
well recollect. But, dearest children, seeing that so greatly has the malice of men
increased in these days, a thing to be deplored&mdash;that temporal punishment is held more
in dread than clerical, and that which touches the body or the purse more than that
which kills the soul, we do heartily intreat you, and, for the love of God and of His law,
do require and exhort you, that, taking counsel thereon, you will enact and ordain a
competent penalty in money, to be levied for the Chamber of your City, or such other
purpose as you shall think best, upon the Barbers within the liberty of your City
aforesaid, who shall be transgressors in this respect; that so at least, those whom fear of
the anger of God does not avail to withold from breach of His law, may be restrained
by a scourge inflicted upon their purse, in the way of pecuniary loss; knowing that we
in the meantime, after taking counsel hereon, will devise measures for the prevention of
this, and for the due publication of our Provincial enactment aforesaid. Fare you well
always in Christ.</p>

<p>Written at <span class="nowrap">Ikham<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> on the 13th day of the month of July.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, Archbishop of Canterbury.”
</p></div>

<p>An Ordinance was forthwith made thereupon, to the effect, that
no barber, his wife, son, daughter, apprentice, or servant, should work<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
at such craft on Sundays within the liberty of the city, either in hair
cutting or shaving, on pain of paying 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for each offence; 5<i>s.</i>
thereof to go to the new work at the Guildhall, and the remainder to
the Wardens or Masters of the Barbers within the city<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span></p>

<p>1422. In August of this year Henry V died, and thirty-two of
the City Companies assisted at his obsequies, going in procession and
carrying torches. From an entry in <i>Letter-Book K.</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">I</span><sup>B.</sup>, it appears
that the Barbers bore four torches on this occasion.</p>

<p>1447. This year the Company seem to have contributed 40<i>s.</i>
towards the cost of the Roof of the Chapel at Guildhall, as appears by
the following entry in <i>Journal IV</i>, 198 (25th October, 26 Henry VI)&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE BARBERS INCORPORATE.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_h.jpg" width="90" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">Hitherto</span> we have considered two distinct and somewhat
hostile fraternities, the Surgeons on the one
hand, and on the other the Barbers (consisting of
Barbers and Barber-Surgeons), both of them City
Guilds, existing by prescription, having independent
rules and Ordinances for their government and the
scrutiny and correction of abuses in their respective Crafts, the former
Company few in number, the latter far more numerous and popular;
the Surgeons without, and the Barbers with, a Livery.</p>

<p>Of these two fraternities, the Barbers by the regular and every
day nature of their calling, as shavers and hair cutters, together with
the practice of Surgery combined by so many of them, were the most
likely to become the more popular Company; their fees would surely be
on a lower scale than those of the more aristocratic Surgeons, and their
numbers and constant intercourse with the citizens, in their capacity as
Barbers, enabled them easily to extend their connection as Surgeons.</p>

<p>In all their contentions with the Surgeons’ Guild, as far as we
know, they held their own well, and thus it was that their place in
the City, as a Livery Guild of at that time an ancient standing, their<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
position as the professors of useful and scientific arts, their numbers and
presumable affluence, all rendered it desirable that they should be
placed upon the same footing as the better class of Guilds, by their
acquisition of a Charter of Incorporation, which they accordingly
obtained from the young King Edward IV in the first year of his
reign (1462).</p>

<p>Thomas Knot (Master, 1555) has recorded in one of our
books, a Translation of this Charter, which Mr. J. Flint South (who
does not appear to have seen the original Latin one) has transcribed,
and this has been adopted by Mr. D’Arcy Power (page 326). Thomas
Knot wrote a good hand, and was a zealous champion of the Barber-Surgeons
in his time, but he made egregious blunders in some of the
writings recorded over his signature, and although there is not great
fault to be found with him in this instance, it is suggested that the
Translation given below, is perhaps a more literal one than that which
Knot has handed down.</p>

<p>The Charter is still preserved at our Hall, and is contained on
a small skin of parchment; the initial letters of the title, which were at
the time left to be illuminated have never been filled in, and the
document is therefore not the work of art which one is accustomed to
see in Charters of this period; it bears signs of having been frequently
used, the ink in some places being worn, and the words only legible
with the aid of a magnifying glass. The great seal pendant is not
quite perfect, but is a beautiful specimen and highly artistic. The
following is the text of the <span class="nowrap">Charter:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span> by the grace of God, King of England and France, and Lord of
Ireland, <span class="smcap">To</span> all to whom these present letters shall come, health. <span class="smcap">Know</span> ye, that we
considering how our beloved, honest, and free men of the Mystery of Barbers of our City<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
of London, exercising the Mystery or Art of Surgery, as well respecting wounds, bruises,
hurts, and other infirmities of our liegemen, and healing and curing the same, as in
letting blood, and drawing the teeth of our liege men, have for a long time undergone
and supported, and daily do undergo and support, great and manifold applications and
labours; and also, how through the ignorance negligence and stupidity of some of the
men of the said Barbers, as well of the freemen of our said City, as of other Surgeons
foreigners and not freemen of the said City, and who daily resort to the said City, and in
the mystery of Surgery are not sufficiently skilled, whereby very many and almost infinite
evils have before this time happened to many of our liegemen, in their wounds, hurts,
bruises, and other infirmities, by such Barbers and Surgeons, on account of their defect
in healing and curing; from which cause, some of our said liegemen have gone the way
of all flesh, and others, through the same cause, have been by all given over as incurable
and past relief, and it is to be dreaded, that similar or greater evils may in future arise on
this head, unless proper remedy is by us, speedily provided for the same. <span class="smcap">We</span> therefore,
heartily weighing and considering that such evils do happen to our liegemen for want of
the examinations, corrections, and punishments by a due supervision of such Barbers
and Surgeons as are insufficiently skilled and instructed in the said mysteries or arts as
aforesaid; have at the humble request of our aforesaid beloved, honest, and freemen of
the said Mystery of Barbers in our said city, granted to them that the said Mystery, and
all men of the said Mystery aforesaid, may be in deed and name one body and one
perpetual Community, and that two Principals of the said Community may, with the
consent of twelve persons, or at least eight of the said Community who are best skilled in
the mystery of Surgery, every year elect and make out of the Community, two Masters
or Governors of the utmost skill, to superintend rule and govern the Mystery and
Community aforesaid and all men of the said Mystery, and of the businesses of the
same for ever. <span class="smcap">And that</span> the said Masters or Governors and Community may have a
perpetual succession and common seal to serve for the affairs of the said Community for
ever, and that they and their successors for ever may be able and capable to acquire and
possess in fee and perpetuity lands, tenements, rents, and other possessions whatsoever,
to the value of five marks per annum, besides reprises. And that they, by the name of
the Masters or Governors and Community of Barbers of London, may be able to plead
and to be impleaded before whatsoever Justices in Courts, and actions whatsoever. And
that the said Masters or Governors and Community, and their successors, may lawfully
and honestly assemble themselves, and make statutes and ordinances for the wholesome
government, superintendence, and correction of the said Mystery, according to the
exigency of the necessity, as often and whenever it may be requisite, lawfully and
unpunishably, without leave or hindrance of us, our heirs or successors, Justices,<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
Escheators, Sheriffs, Coroners, or any other Bailiffs, or servants of us, our heirs or
successors; provided that such statutes or ordinances are not in any ways contrary
to the laws and customs of our Kingdom of England. <span class="smcap">We further</span> will and grant,
for us, our heirs and successors, as far as in us lies, that the Masters or Governors of the
aforesaid Community for the time being, and their successors for ever, shall have the
superintendence, scrutiny, correction, and government of all and singular the freemen of
the said City who are Surgeons, exercising the Mystery of Barbers within the said City,
and of all other foreign Surgeons whomsoever, in anywise practising and using the said
Mystery of Surgeons in the said City and the suburbs thereof, and the punishment of
them, as well freemen as foreigners, for their offences in not perfectly following, practising
and using that mystery, and also the superintendence and scrutiny of all kinds of
instruments, plaisters, and other medicines, and their recipes, by such Barbers and
Surgeons given, applied, and used for our liege men, for curing and healing their wounds,
bruises, hurts and such kind of infirmities, when and as often as shall be requisite for the
convenience and utility of our liege men; so that punishment of such Barbers exercising
the said mystery of Surgeons, so offending in the premisses, be executed by fines,
amerciaments, and imprisonments of their bodies, and by other reasonable and suitable
means; and that no Barber exercising the said mystery of Surgeons in the said City and
suburbs thereof, or any other foreign Surgeon whatsoever, shall in future be admitted to
follow, practise and exercise the said mystery of Surgeons, in anywise, within the said
City or the suburbs thereof, unless he be first approved by the said Masters or Governors,
or their successors, for this purpose able and sufficient as skilled in the said Mystery,
and for his plenary approbation in this behalf, by the said Masters or Governors to
the Mayor of the said City for the time being, presented. <span class="smcap">We also</span> will and grant,
for us our heirs and successors, as far as in us lies, that neither the said Masters or
Governors and community of the said Mystery of Barbers, nor their successors, nor any
of them shall hereafter, in anywise be summoned or appointed on any assizes, juries,
inquests, inquisitions, attainders, or other recognizances, within the said City or suburbs
thereof for the time to come, before the Mayor or Sheriffs or Coroners of our said
City for the time being, by any summoning officer or his servant, or summoning officers
or their servants, although the said juries, inquisitions, or recognizances should be
summoned by a writ or writs of right, of us or our heirs, but that the said Masters or
Governors and Community of the aforesaid Mystery and their successors shall,
from henceforth for ever, be peaceably and entirely exonerated towards us, our
heirs and successors, and towards the Mayor and Sheriffs of our said City for the
time being, and every of their officers and servants, by these presents. <span class="smcap">And further</span>,
we, in consideration of the premisses, do of our special grace, for us and our successors,<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
grant to the said Masters or Governors and Community of the said Mystery of Barbers,
and their successors, this liberty, to wit, that they in all future times may admit
and receive persons apt and sufficiently skilled and informed in the said Mystery of
Surgery, and by the Masters or Governors for the time being of the said Mystery, in
manner aforesaid approved, and presented to the Mayor of the said City for the time
being as aforesaid, into the said Mystery of Barbers to the fredom of the said City,
to be held and enjoyed according to the custom of the said City; and no other persons
whomsoever, nor in any other manner, any mandate or requisition of us, our heirs
or successors, by written letters or otherwise howsoever made or to be made to
the contrary notwithstanding. <span class="smcap">And although</span> the said Masters or Governors and
Community and their successors should contumaciously use this liberty in future
against any mandate or requisition of us, our heirs, or successors, or any others
whomsoever to be made in form aforesaid, neither they nor any of them shall in anywise
incur any fine, contempt, or loss towards us, our heirs or successors, or any damage or
punishment in their goods or bodies, or towards any other persons whatsoever, on that
account; <span class="smcap">And</span> this without fine or fee for the sealing of these presents, to be done
paid or otherwise rendered unto us; any statute, ordinance, or any act to the contrary,
before this time published made ordained or provided notwithstanding <span class="smcap">In witness</span>
whereof, we have caused these our letters to be made patent. <span class="smcap">Witness</span> myself at

</div>

<p>The chief point which strikes us on reading the foregoing
Charter is, that it contains a great deal relative to Surgery, and little,
indeed nothing, concerning Barbery, and yet it is granted ostensibly
to the Barbers!</p>

<p>Now the Surgical side being the more important one of the
craft, and the <i>raison d’être</i> of the Charter being in a great measure to
provide for the regulation of Surgery and the correction of abuses in<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
that profession, this silence as to Barbery and recognition of Surgery
would seem to be an evidence that the practice of the latter, more or
less, was the rule rather than the exception with members of the
Company of Barbers; and, as the Masters or Governors were
empowered to make “statutes and ordinances” (by-laws) for the
governance of the mystery, it was doubtless considered unnecessary
to descend into any details concerning shaving and the like in a
Royal Charter.</p>

<p>The preamble of this Charter is exceedingly quaint and
interesting, reciting how through the “ignorance, negligence and
stupidity” of various Barbers and other practitioners in Surgery,
many of the King’s lieges had “gone the way of all flesh.” Then at
the request of “our beloved, honest and free men of the said Mystery
of Barbers,” the King grants to them, to be one body perpetual, etc.,
that two of the chief men of the Company (no doubt the two then
existing Masters “exercising the faculty of Surgery”) may with twelve
or at least eight other skilled Barber-Surgeons, elect two Masters
annually: this provision in itself is singular, as it would seem to imply
that the body then incorporated was to be ruled by two Masters only;
but a reference to our list of Masters and Wardens will shew that from
the year 1448 the Company has been ruled by four Masters, and so on
in unbroken succession to the present <span class="nowrap">time<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span>; these other two Masters
therefore were Masters of the Barbers proper, about whom nothing
was said in the Charter, but who were chosen annually in accordance
with ancient custom, the Chief or First Master being alternately a
Barber, and a Barber-Surgeon.</p>

<p>The Corporation was to have perpetual succession, and a
Common seal, to hold lands of a certain value, to be able to plead and<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
to be impleaded, to make by-laws, to have the scrutiny and correction
of (apparently <i>all</i>) Surgeons in the City and suburbs, as also the
oversight of all their instruments and medicines, etc., and to have the
power of inflicting punishment, by fine or imprisonment, on offenders.
None were to practise Surgery until examined and approved by the
Masters and presented to the Mayor, and authority was given for the
freemen of the Company to be admitted into the freedom of the City.</p>

<p>Another clause in the Charter was one which, whilst it conferred
a valuable privilege upon the Company, was a source of
continual strife and conflict with the Civic authorities, for by it <i>all</i> our
freemen claimed to be exempted from serving on Juries and inquisitions,
and this immunity, though constantly disputed, was as often
asserted and maintained, with various qualifications.</p>

<p>In <i>The Times</i>, November 26, 1839, is an account of the exemption
of certain freemen of the Company from serving on Juries at the
Central Criminal Court. In this instance neither the claimants nor the
Recorder knew much about the matter&mdash;for one of the applicants said,
in reply to the Recorder, “I rest my claim on the Charter of
<i>Henry VIII</i>”<i>!!</i> And, further on in the discussion, the same bold
Barber had the effrontery to declare that “the privilege was confirmed
by an Act passed in the reign of George II.” This was the Act
which separated the Surgeons from the Barbers, and which did <i>not</i>
confirm to the latter the exemption claimed, but our freeman gained
his point, and the Recorder only grumbled.</p>

<p>As recently as 1868, a case was submitted to Sir J.&nbsp;D. Coleridge
(now Lord Chief Justice) as to the legality of the exemption, and he
gave his opinion in favour of it. However, since then the Jury Act
has, alas! swept away this cherished immunity, and thus let the Barbers
down to the level of their fellow citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span></p>

<p>With the possession of their Charter the Company were now in
an unassailable position, and we hear no more of their molestation by
the Guild of Surgeons.</p>

<div class="ml3em" style="width: 500px;"><p class="ti0em"><i>Grant</i> by <span class="smcap">Richard Thornbury</span>, Citizen and Draper of London, to Robert Ferbras, Citizen and Surgeon, John Dagvile, Surgeon, William Sipnam, Grocer, and Walter Bartlot,
Fishmonger, Citizens of London, for ever, of all his title in two shops and solars with their appurtenances, in the parish of Saint John upon Walbroke, formerly belonging to
John Blounde of Braughyng in the County of Hertford, and which had been already conveyed to the Grantees by John Thornbury, gentleman, and Walter Thornbury, Clerk,
which shops were situate between the tenements of William Horn, Citizen and Draper, towards the north and south, and the tenement of the Prior and Convent of the Blessed
Mary without Bishopsgate towards the east, and the King’s highway leading from Walbroke to Dowgate towards the west. Dated 11th May, 2 Edward IV (1462).</p></div>
</div>

<p>1470. The Company about this period came into possession of
some freehold houses in St. John the Baptist upon Walbrook, to be
held both for trust and corporate purposes. These houses are stated
in our books to have been devised to us by Will (dated 2nd Dec., 1470)
of Robert Ferbras. There are three old title deeds of the period still
at the Hall, relating to these houses, and in the Court of Husting at
Guildhall are two Wills of Robert Ferbras, Surgeon, both proved, one
dated 4th Nov., 1470, and the other 17th April, 1472&mdash;but neither of
these contain the bequest to the Barbers. It is, therefore, probable
that Robert Ferbras conveyed the houses to the Company in his lifetime,
and this fact being overlooked in course of years, it came to be
said that they passed by his Will.</p>

<p>1482. 26th April.&mdash;The Company applied to the Court of Aldermen,
presenting a set of ordinances for the government of the craft and for
the regulation of apprentices, praying that the same might be allowed
and ratified, which was done. The official entry under this date is in
<i>Letter-Book L.</i> 174, and the following are the <span class="nowrap">Ordinances:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1490. A declaration made by one Bryan Sandford, dated
8th March, 1490, was produced to the Committee of the House of<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
Commons in 1745, in which it was stated that the Company were
at that time possessed of the freehold of their Hall in Monkwell
Street.</p>

<p>1493. On the 12th July in this year, an agreement was
entered into between the Barbers’ Company and the Surgeons’
Guild which would indicate that the two bodies were now on amicable
terms, working harmoniously for the increase of the credit of the
profession, and for the correction of inexperienced surgeons and
empirics. This “Composition” is of so interesting a nature that
it is here given in full, as extracted from the fine old Book
of Ordinances at the Hall; it did not unite the two bodies
in any way beyond this, that they agreed to follow the same
rules and practice with regard to the government of all
Surgeons; that each guild was to choose two Wardens, and
that the four so chosen were to act in a conjoint capacity as
rulers or masters in matters surgical, and thus comprehend all
Surgeons, whether of the Barbers’ Company, the Surgeons’
Guild, or “foreyns.”</p>

<p>Of the persons assenting to this composition, the following were
Barber-Surgeons, viz.: Rob<sup>t.</sup> Halyday (Master 1475, 1483, 1485, 1490,
1496), James Scott (M. 1493, 1498, 1500), James Ingoldysby (M. 1501,
1506), John Taylour (M. 1523, 1524), and Nicholas Leveryng(M. 1503,
1508), the others were most likely belonging to the Guild of Surgeons.</p>

<p>An Ordinance by way of addenda to the above was made,
imposing penalties upon any who should break any of the foregoing
rules; the first offence to be punished by a fine of 10<i>s.</i>, the second 20<i>s.</i>,
and the third offence to be remitted to the Mayor and Aldermen for
punishment after their discretion.</p>

<p>How long this agreement, so beneficial for the practice of
Surgery, continued in force is unknown; but the probabilities are that
the old jealousies soon re-appeared and that each Guild worked on its
own lines until 1540, as, by the uniting Act then passed, it was specially
remarked as desirable that the two Companies should come together,
and be incorporated in one.</p>

<p>1497. We shall now present to the reader’s notice a highly
important document, being a diploma granted by the Master and
Wardens of the Barbers’ Company to one of their freemen, enabling
him to practise as a Surgeon. This is in all probability the earliest
English diploma of a Surgeon extant and cannot fail by the quaintness
of its composition, and the details given, to prove of much interest.
We notice in it, that our Company as usual, did not fail to rehearse its
prerogatives and practice, and we also observe that thus early the
Company provided an instructor and examiner in the science, Dr. John
Smith, before whom came in the Common Hall, Robert Anson, and
in the presence of a “great audience of many right well expert men
in Surgery and others, was openly examined in divers things concerning
the practice,” etc.</p>

<p>1499. In this year the Company obtained from Henry VII a
confirmation of their Charter, paying but 20<i>s.</i> for the same. This
Inspeximus Charter recites and confirms that of Edward IV with
the very noticeable exceptions, that four Masters or Governors are
named instead of two, and that they are described as of “the
<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>Mystery of Barbers and Surgeons,” and not “Barbers” only, as
in Edward’s grant.</p>

<p>1511. In this year an Act of Parliament was passed, which
infringed on the privileges of the Barbers’ Company, inasmuch as it
placed the approbation and licensing of Surgeons in the hands of
certain clerical dignitaries, to wit, the Bishop of London and Dean of
St. Paul’s (while for the country the several Bishops or their Vicars
general were nominated). This Act was possibly the outcome of some
laxity on the part of our Company, or of an intolerable growth of
quackery, with which it could not cope, the pretenders to surgical
knowledge being a “great multitude” of ignorant persons, and women,
using sorcery, witchcraft and noxious remedies. This Act of Parliament
(3 Hen. VIII, cap. XI) as given below, is from an original copy
in the possession of Mr. Charles J. Shoppee (Master 1878).</p>


<div class="center">¶ AN ACTE CONCERNYNG THE APPROBATION OF PHISICIONS AND SURGIONS.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the kyng our souerayne lorde, and to all the lordes spiritual and temporall,
&amp; comoñs in this present parlyament assembled. <span class="smcap">Forasmoche</span> as the science and
connynge of phisike &amp; surgerie (to the perfet knowlege whereof, be requisite both great
lernyng and rype experience) is dayly within this realme exercised by a great multitude of
ignorant pˀsons: of whome the great part haue no maner of insight in the same, nor in
any other kynde of lernynge, some also can no letters on the boke, so farforthe that
common artificers, as smythes, weauers, and women, boldely and customably take upon<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
them greate cures and thinges of greate difficultie: in the whiche they partly use sorcerye,
and witchcrafte, partly apply suche medicines unto the disease, as be very noyous and
nothyng metely therfore to the highe displeasure of god, great infamye to the facultie, and
the greuous hurte, damage, and destruction of many of the kynges liege people: most
specially of them that can not discerne the unconnynge from connynge. Be it therfore
(to the suertie and comforte of all maner people) by auctoritie of this present parliament
enacted, that no persone within the citie of London, nor within seuen myles of the same,
take upon hym to exercise and occupie as a phisition or surgion, excepte he be fyrst
examyned, approued, and admytted by the byshop of London, or by the deane of Paules,
for the tyme beinge, calling to hym or them foure doctours of phisike, and for surgery,
other experte persons in that facultie, and for the fyrste examination suche as they shall
thynke conuenient, and afterwarde alway foure of them that haue ben so approued, upon
the peine of forfayture, for euery moneth that they do occupie as phisitions or surgions,
not admytted nor examyned after the tenour of this acte, of v.li. to be enployed the one
halfe therof to thuse of our soueraine lorde the kynge, and the other halfe therof to any
person that wyll sue for it by action of dette, in whiche no wager of lawe nor protection
shalbe alowed.</p>

<p>¶ And ouer this, that no persone out of the sayd citie and precinte of vii. myles
of the same, except he haue ben (as is aforesayd) approued in y<sup>e</sup> same, take upon hym to
exercise and occupie as a phisition or surgion, in any diocesse within this realme, but if he
be fyrste examined and approued by the bysshoppe of the same dyocese, or he beynge
out of the dioces by his vycare generall: either of them callyng to them suche experte
persones in the sayde faculties, as their discretion shal thynke conuenient, and gyuyng
theyr letters testimonials under theyr seale to hym that they shall so approue, upon lyke
peyne to them that occupie contrary to this acte (as is above sayde) to be leuied
and employed after the forme before expressed.</p>

<p>¶ Prouyded alway, that this acte nor any thynge therin contayned, be
preiudiciall to the uniuersities of Oxforde and Cambrydge or eyther of them, or to any
priuileges graunted to them.</p></div>

<p>This Act seems to have invested the Bishops, etc., with the
power of licensing <i>all</i> Surgeons, and if so, would have taken away that
privilege from our Company; the point is however doubtful, and I am
inclined to think that the Act did not operate to the prejudice of the<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
Company, only in so far as it suffered from the existence of another
licensing authority.</p>

<p>Mr. D’Arcy Power has pointed out that the Act very soon
became unpopular, and that it was almost immediately practically
repealed by another one, which provided that it should be “lawful to
any person being the king’s subject, having knowledge or experience
of the nature of herbs, etc., to minister in and to any outward sore
or wound according to their cunning.” (Memorials of the Craft of
Surgery, p.&nbsp;85.)</p>

<p>This latter Act, which in its effect would flood the land with
quacks, must however have remained the law until the Act of
32 Hen. VIII, whereby the Barber-Surgeons were reinstated in their
ancient rights; and it is the fact, that down to the 18th Century
the Ecclesiastics claimed and enforced their rights (under the Act
3 Hen. VIII) to license Surgeons, notwithstanding other Acts passed
since then, which although not expressly extinguishing their power,
certainly did not save it. The Barber-Surgeons’ Company seem
to have examined the Surgeons, and, if approved, to have given
a certificate under Seal, which was presented to the Bishop who
thereupon issued his licence. This practice was not however universal,
and I think only applied to some Surgeons who were not free of the
Company. In some cases the Bishop licensed Surgeons, without
reference to the Company, and thousands have been licensed by the
Company without regard to the Bishop. It is almost impossible to say
now what course was followed, the practice certainly varying with the
times (see <a href="#Page_308">Surgery</a>).</p>

<p>1513. In this year an Act of Parliament was passed exempting
Surgeons from juries, inquests, etc. This must have been passed in<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
the interest of the Surgeons’ Guild, as the Barber-Surgeons were surely
exempt under their Charter from Edward IV.</p>

<p>1512. The Barbers’ Company having applied to the King
(Henry VIII) for a confirmation of their Charter, their request was
acceded to. Henry is, on more than one occasion, spoken of in the
books as “our patron,” and there is no doubt but that he was very
friendly both to our Company and to individual members of it, as
witness his gift of the grace cup, and the legacies in his will to various
members of the Company, with some of whom, as Pen, Harman,
Ayliff, etc., he was on as intimate terms as a king could be with a
subject; there would therefore be, we may be sure, but little difficulty
in obtaining an Inspeximus.</p>

<p>In one of our Minute Books, Thomas Knot (Master 1555) has
transcribed what purports to be a copy of Henry’s Inspeximus Charter
with the date 12<sup>th</sup> of May “in the xviij<sup>th</sup> yere of our Reigne” (<i>i.e.</i>, 1526),
and he appends a certificate that he has compared and agreed it with
the original! Now we possess the original at Barbers’ Hall and it is
dated 12<sup>th</sup> March 3<sup>rd</sup> Henry VIII (<i>i.e.</i>, 1512), and it would indeed
be a strange thing for Henry VIII in 1526 to recite and confirm
Henry VII’s Charter, when he had already done so in 1512. Moreover
I have searched the Patent Rolls and whilst there is no record
in 1526, there is the entry of the 1512 Charter, and further to fix the
date, both Philip and Mary, and Elizabeth in their Inspeximus
Charters recite the 1512 Charter.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to enter into this detail, as the date of
the Charter is important when we come to consider Holbein’s picture;
and as my friend Mr. D’Arcy Power has (p.&nbsp;338) quoted this pretended
Charter not having seen the real one, he, very naturally trusting old<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
Thomas Knot’s statement, has fallen into the pit dug some three
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The following is the Text of the Charter, and it will not be
necessary to append a translation, as it follows much on the same
lines as that of Henry <span class="nowrap">VII:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>An Act of Parliament was passed in the 20th Henry VII,
which provided that the governing bodies of Guilds should not make
any by-laws or ordinances, without the same should be approved by
the Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer, and the Chief Justices of the
King’s Bench and Common Pleas, or any three of them, etc., and
in 1530 our Company, being desirous of settling many points for
the government of the mystery, drew up a long set of interesting
Ordinances, which were presented to Sir Thomas More the Chancellor,
Sir John Fitzjames and Sir Robert
Norwiche the Chief Justices, and were
signed by them on the 14th May, 1530.

of 20th Henry VII, ordains the following oaths and <span class="nowrap">articles:&mdash;</span></p>

the <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B</a>, the transcript being made from the original<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span></p>

<p>1540. This year is one of the most memorable in the annals of
the Barber-Surgeons, as it witnessed the union of the unincorporated
Guild of Surgeons, with their more accredited fellow-craftsmen, the
incorporated Company of Barbers. It has been suggested by more
than one writer that such an union is shrouded in mystery, difficult of
explanation, and that in those days, with science advancing (slowly, it
is true), it might have been expected that we should read of a divorcement,
rather than a combination of two crafts, which then, as now, were
dissimilar both in their operations, and in the training and intelligence
necessary for their practice.</p>

<p>But it is essential to bear in mind that though the Charter of
Edward IV was ostensibly to the Barbers, it really was granted to a
fraternity, which to a great extent practised as Barber-Surgeons, some
of whom were Surgeons pure and simple, others combined both
branches, while others still carried on the more humble craft of
Shavers and Hair-Dressers; those of the Company who practised
Surgery did no doubt consider it a reproach to be dubbed “Barbers,”
and for distinction sake called themselves and were well known as
“Barber-Surgeons,” indeed they had so far established this title to<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
themselves and to their Company, as to get it recognised and so
named in the Inspeximus Charter of Henry VII (less than forty years
after their original Charter as “Barbers” had been granted to them).
This is to a great extent confirmed by the words of the Act now about
to be referred to, which distinctly says that there was then a Company
of “Surgeons occupyinge and exercisynge the sayde scyence and
faculty of surgery .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. commonly called the Barbours
of London.”</p>

<p>The Union therefore was not a joining of Barbers with
Surgeons (<span class="lowercase smcap">THAT</span> had existed from the earliest times), but was the
consolidation of the “Guild of Surgeons” with another body of
Surgeons who were incorporated, and practised under the name of
“Barbers” in conjunction with actual working Barbers; and, as the
Act provided what the Surgeons should and should not do, and the
like as to actual Barbers, limiting their operations also, most if not all
difficulty and apparent incongruity in the union seems to vanish.</p>

<p>The Act (32 Hen. VIII, cap. 42) which will well repay perusal,
settled the Barber-Surgeons in their corporate capacity for many a
long year; under it the old rival society disappeared, it being declared
that the two Companies should be united, so that by their assembling
together, the science of Surgery might be fostered and improved;
whereupon it was enacted that they should be incorporated under the
style of “<span class="smcap">The Maisters or Governours of the Mystery and
Comminalte of Barbours and Surgeons of London.</span>” The
property of the old Company of Barbers was handed over to the
new Corporation (the Guild of Surgeons are not said to have had any
property to bring into the new concern). The usual grant of a common
seal, of power to plead and to be impleaded, to hold lands, etc., will be
seen at large in the Act. The Surgeons of the Company were to be
exempt from bearing armour or being put into watches and inquests.<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
The dead bodies of four malefactors were assigned to the Company
yearly for dissections. And, inasmuch as various persons exercising
the faculty of Surgery used to take into their houses for cure, people
afflicted with the pestilence and other contagious diseases and “do use
or exercise barbari, as washynge or shavyng and other feates thereunto
belonging,<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> the same was declared “veraie perillous,” and it was
enacted that no one using the faculty of Surgery should practise
Barbery, and that no Barber should practise any point in Surgery,
the drawing of teeth only excepted. The Surgeons were to exhibit a
sign in front of their houses, and no Barber was to exercise his calling
unless free of the Company. Four Masters were to rule the Company,
whereof two were to be Barbers and two Surgeons. A penalty was
named for offenders against the articles, all were to pay scot and lot,
and private persons might keep their own Barber or Surgeon, without
interference by the Company.</p>

<p>The Act was passed on the 24th July, 1540, and will be found
in <a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a>. being taken from the original Black-letter copy in
the Author’s possession.</p>

<p>We now refer to the Company’s chief treasure, the Holbein
picture, and are at once met with a difficulty; does it represent the
<i>granting of a Charter</i> to the Company? if so, the year was 1512;
or does it illustrate the union of the Barbers and Surgeons by <i>Act of
Parliament</i>? if so, the year was 1540.</p>

<p>The picture exhibits a Charter with the Great Seal pendant,
and has always been popularly known and described as the “granting
of the Charter to the Barber-Surgeons.” On the other hand,
however, the King was but 21 years of age in 1512 and 49 years
in 1540, which latter age accords with the picture; moreover, Vicary,<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
Ayleff, Harman, and the others represented, were members of the
Court in the latter year, but not in 1512. These considerations are
sufficient to demolish the “Charter” theory, and point to the
hypothesis that it is the Union of the Barbers’ Company with the
Guild of Surgeons, accomplished by Act of Parliament in 1540, which
is <i>commemorated</i>, but then we must admit a licence on the part of
Holbein (which deceived no one at the time), when he indulged his
artist’s fancy by putting into the King’s hand a Charter with seal
pendant, instead of an Act of Parliament, which latter would not
indeed have been the King’s function to hand to the Company, and
would probably, if represented, have been depicted as a mere roll,
and not therefore so artistic or effective as a Charter with a Seal
in the King’s hand.</p>

<p>The Act received the Royal Assent 25th July, 1540; this
would be towards the close of the year of John Pen’s mastership.
Vicary, who is receiving the Instrument, was Master from September,
1541, to September, 1542; there is every probability that the painting
was executed during his year of office, and that is why Holbein paid
him the compliment of putting him in the chief position in the
painting, which after all was intended, not as a strictly historical, but
rather as a commemorative picture.</p>

<p>The picture is 10 feet 2 inches long by 5 feet 11 inches high,
painted on oak panel and contains nineteen figures; it represents a
room in the palace (said to have been Bridewell), which is hung with
beautiful tapestry and appears to have been gilded; the King is seated
on a throne, his age apparently about fifty, the complexion florid, the
hair sandy, the eyes small but animated and restless; the expression
on the countenance is impatience, and he seems thrusting the document
hastily into the hand of Thomas Vicary, who receives it kneeling, on<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
his left; the face altogether might be pronounced handsome, were it
not for the low forehead and contracted eyebrows; he has on his left
thumb a signet ring, and other rings on the first and fourth fingers of
his right hand with which he holds a sword of state resting on his
knee; on his head is a jewelled crown; on his left leg the garter, and
round his neck the collar of the Order; the mantle is short and of
crimson velvet; all these ornaments are most beautifully executed and
are as fine as miniature painting; every hair of his head is distinct, and
the texture of his robe is finely given; his impatience seems to have
warmed him, and the rising colour flushing over his face is most
admirably painted. On the King’s right are three grave and closely
shaved personages on their knees. The first is Dr. John Chambre, one
of the Royal Physicians, he is represented in a skull cap and furred
gown, the sleeves very large and in which his hands are enwrapped;
from the expression of his countenance it would seem that he was
anything but pleased with the provisions of the Act, as the face has a
sullen and discontented look; next to him is the celebrated Dr. William
Butts, also one of Henry’s Physicians, and behind him is Thomas
Alsop, the Royal Apothecary, his hair is long and lank, and features
coarse and hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/img018.jpg" width="530" height="315" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On the King’s left are fifteen members of the Court on their
knees, and in livery gowns, evidently specially sumptuous for the
occasion, being of brocaded or damask silk, trimmed with fur, and
each man wears a livery hood of red and black upon his shoulder. The
first of these is Thomas Vicary, Serjeant-Surgeon, who wears a gold
chain; next comes Sir John Ayleff, Surgeon to the King, also with a
gold chain and a ring on his finger, the next is Nicholas Simpson,
King’s Barber, who, like Vicary and Ayleff, wears a skull cap, all the
others have their heads bare. Then comes Edmund Harman, King’s
Barber, and one of the Witnesses to Henry’s Will, he wears a gold<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
chain; next him is James Monforde, King’s Surgeon, then John Pen,
the King’s Barber, and Nicholas Alcocke; the expression on the
countenances of all these men is grave and solemn; the next, Richard
Ferris, who has a somewhat merrier face, and was also King’s Surgeon,
completes the front row. The moustaches and beards of the whole,
including the King, would appear as if they had had great care and
attention bestowed upon them. Of the remaining seven figures in the
back row, the names of but two have been preserved, viz., Christopher
Salmond and William Tilley.</p>

<p>This picture of Holbein’s is not surpassed, if indeed it is
equalled, by any other of that master, every part is most elaborately
and delicately finished; the position of none of the figures is
constrained, and there is no attempt at theatrical effect, yet
every person represented is in action, the colouring is chaste,
and kept down, nor is there any of that hardness and stiffness
often observed in Holbein’s pictures. Its reputation has been
truly said to be world-wide, whilst it has been eulogistically
described by some one to be “as glowing as a Titian, and
minutely faithful as a Gerard Dow.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span></p>

<p>The names of the persons represented have been somewhat
rudely affixed to their effigies, probably a few years after the
picture was painted, and whilst we cannot but deplore the disfigurement,
it is more than compensated for, as the means of
identification of so many of our illustrious predecessors. The
tablet, with inscription, has been said to be of later date than
Holbein’s work, and to have been painted over a window, through
which was once seen the old church of St. Bride; this, however,<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
is most improbable, as it is personally dedicatory to Henry. The
inscription is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The following fragmentary notices of the persons represented in
the picture, will be found of some interest.</p>

<p>The first figure to the left is Thomas Alsop; he was the King’s
Apothecary, and Henry VIII, by his will, left him 100 marks.</p>

<p>Next to him is Dr. William Butts, one of the King’s physicians,
ever famous for his memorable interference with the King on behalf of
Archbishop Cranmer in 1544, when the Roman Catholic party in the
Council endeavoured to procure Cranmer’s committal to the Tower.
A full account of this incident will be found in Strype’s Memorials of
Cranmer (Oxford Ed., 1812, pp. 177–181), and Shakespeare in his play
of Henry VIII (act v., sc. 2) has also graphically described it.
Cranmer’s Secretary, aware of Butts’ great influence with the King,
sent for the Doctor, and acquainted him with the slight which had been
put upon the Archbishop by keeping him standing in the ante-room of
the Council Chamber among lacqueys and servingmen, upon which
Butts immediately repaired to the King, and <span class="nowrap">said:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span></p>

<p>Henry spoke his mind so freely to the Council, that they one and all
shook hands with the Archbishop, and, as Strype says, “Never more
durst any man spurn him during King Henry’s life.”</p>

<p>Dr. Butts must have had the best practice of any man of his
time; there are several references to him among the State papers at
the Record Office, of which the following are a few examples, and
indicate that his patients were the aristocracy of the day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>25th May, 1524. Among the funeral expenses of Sir Thomas Lovell, K.G.,
is this item:&mdash;“To John Hewson, riding to Cambridge, to fetch Dr. Buttes when my
master was sick, 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>28th April, 1525. The Duke of Norfolk, writing to Cardinal Wolsey, says that
last night at 7 o’clock the Lord Marney was “drawyng the draghts of deth, and Mr. Butts
determyned he shuld not lyve after 5 owrys” (hours).</p>

<p>14th October, 1525. A warrant was signed by Wolsey, directed to Sir Andrew
Windsor, for delivery to Dr. Butts, who had been appointed physician to my lady Princess,
of a livery in blue and green, in damask for himself, and in cloth for his two servants.</p>

<p>17th May, 1528. In a letter from the Duke of Norfolk to Wolsey, the Duke
says that Mr. Butts had come to him from the King, without whose aid he thought that
he should not have recovered from his sickness.</p>

<p>23rd June, 1528. In a letter from Brian Tuke (to Cardinal Wolsey) he speaks
of an infection which had been much about of late, and how the King told him that
Mistress Ann Boleyn and my lord Rochford both have had it; what jeopardy they have
been in, by the turning in of the sweat before the time; of the endeavour of Mr. Buttes
who hath been with them in his return; and finally of their perfect recovery.</p>

<p>19th January, 1530. A letter from De Augustinis, written from the palace at Esher,
to Cromwell, desires that Dr. Butts or Dr. Walter Cromer may be sent to the Cardinal
and requesting that Balthazar the physician, may be spoken to, to obtain some leeches;
no time was to be lost and the doctors were to bring with them some vomitive electuary.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Butts was a personal friend of Henry’s, who, in 1537,
granted him the manor and advowson of Thornage, in Norfolk. He<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
died 17th November, 1545, and lies buried in Fulham Church, where
there is (or was) a monument to his memory.</p>

<p>Next to Butts, and immediately to the King’s right, is Dr. John
Chambre; he was physician to and a great favorite of Henry’s, holding
several clerical preferments as well. He was a Fellow and Warden of
Merton College, Oxon, where he was admitted Doctor of Physic,
29th October, 1531. In the list of persons to whom Wolsey, in 1526,
assigned lodgings at the King’s house, when they should repair
thither, occurs the name of Dr. Chambre. There is also a catalogue
of the King’s new year’s gifts, in 1528, by which it appears that
the Doctor had a piece of plate weighing 24<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&nbsp;ozs., at the
same time the Cardinal’s gift was 40<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;ozs., and that of the
Archbishop 31&nbsp;ozs.</p>

<p>In Brian Tuke’s letter (23rd June, 1528), before referred to, he
tells Wolsey that when he called on the King with his letters, he found
him in “secret communication with his physician, Mr. Chambre, in a
tower, where he sometimes sups apart.”</p>

<p>Dr. Chambre was Dean of St. Stephen’s Chapel, Westminster,
Canon of Windsor, Archdeacon of Bedford, Prebendary of Comb and
Harnham in Salisbury Cathedral, Treasurer of Wells Cathedral, and
beneficed in Somersetshire and Yorkshire. Truly the lines had fallen
unto him in pleasant places!</p>

<p>He was one of the physicians in attendance on Queen Jane, at
the birth of Edward VI, and in a letter written by him to the Privy
Council, concerning the Queen’s critical state, he signs himself
“priest.” He was also in attendance on Anne Boleyn, in her
confinement with Elizabeth. His name is mentioned with that
of Linacre and three others, in the Charter to the College of
Physicians, in 1518.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span></p>

<p>Sir William Compton, K.G., in 1522, nominated Dr. Chambre
one of his executors, in conjunction with the Bishop of Exeter, and
Sir Henry Marney, Lord Privy Seal.</p>

<p>Dr. Chambre built a “very curious cloyster,” in St. Stephen’s
Chapel, which cost him 11,000 marks, and he gave the canons of that
chapel some lands. He died in 1549.</p>

<p>On the King’s left is, first, Thomas Vicary (sometimes Vicars
and Vyccary), Master of the Barbers in 1530, and of the Barber-Surgeons
in 1541, 1546, 1548 and 1557. He was a man of great
eminence in his profession, having been Surgeon to St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, and Serjeant-Surgeon to Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and
Elizabeth. He was the author of “The Profitable Treatise of
Anatomy” in “The Englishman’s Treasure, with the true Anatomie
of Man’s Body.” An account of Vicary will be found in D’Arcy
Power, pp. 102, etc., and several particulars relating to his connection
with St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, are recorded in a paper by Dr.
Norman Moore (Hospital Reports, vol. xviii, pp. 333–358); see also
Dr. Furnivall’s exhaustive account (Early English Text Society).</p>

<p>Next comes Sir John Ayleff (Aylif, Aylyff, etc.). He was
Master of the Barbers in 1538, and Surgeon to the King, with whom
he was doubtless on terms of friendship, as Henry bequeathed him
100 marks. Ayleff treated Henry for fistula and cured him, at
Brinkworth in Wilts, for which the King bestowed upon him a great
estate there in gratification. He subsequently became a Merchant of
Blackwell Hall, Sheriff of London in 1548, and Alderman of Bridge
Without in 1550.</p>

<p>17th July, 1550. In the Repertories of the Court of Aldermen
is a Record that the Court of the Barber-Surgeons gave their assent<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
to the Translation of Sir John from theirs to the Grocers’ Company,
of which Company he was crowned Upper Warden 9th June, 1556.</p>

<p>Sir John Ayleff was buried 20th October, 1556, in the Church
of St. Michael Bassishaw, where there was formerly a marble tomb
with this inscription <span class="nowrap">thereon&mdash;</span></p>

whom nothing is known to me, but that he was “King’s Barber,” and
Master of the Barbers in 1537.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span></p>

<p>Edmund Harman, “King’s Barber,” follows next; he was
admitted to the freedom in 1530, and served Master in 1540. Henry
VIII bequeathed him 200 marks, and he was one of the attesting
witnesses to the King’s will. There are several references to him
among the State Papers and Household Ordinances. His dignified
bearing and expression in the picture are very striking.</p>

<p>James Monforde (or Mumford), “King’s Surgeon,” is next; he
was Upper Warden in 1540 and again in 1543, but never served as
Master. He gave the Company their silver hammer, still used by the
Masters in presiding at Courts.</p>

<p>Then comes John Pen (Penn or Penne), “King’s Barber,” and
Groom of the Privy Chamber; he was admitted to the freedom in
1527 and was Master 1539. He married Lucy, daughter and heiress
of Edmond Chevall, of Coddicote, Herts, by whom he had a good
estate and seven children (<i>vide</i> Harl. Soc. Pub. xxii., 82 &amp; 116).</p>

<p>In Liber Niger Domus Regis (Harl. MS. 642) among the
orders made for the regulation of the Household of Henry VIII
was one, that none but fifteen persons whose names are specified
should be allowed to enter the Privy Chamber, and one of these
is John Penne.</p>

<p>The following quaint regulation, concerning the King’s Barber,
is to be found in the same <span class="nowrap">MS.&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item. It is alsoe ordeyned that the Kingꝭ Barbor shalbe daylie by the Kingꝭ
upriseinge readdye and attendant in the Kingꝭ Privye Chamber there haveinge in
reddynesse his Water Basons Knyvesꝭ Combes scissourꝭ and such other stuffe as to his
Roome doth appertaine for trymminge and dressinge of the Kingꝭ heade and bearde.
And that the sayd Barbour take a speciall regarde to the pure and cleane keepinge of
his owne p’son and apparrell useinge himselfe allwayes honestlye in his conversationne
withoute resortinge to the Companye of vile personnes or of misguided woemen in<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
avoydeinge such daunger as by that meanes hee might doe unto the Kingꝭ most Royall
person not fayling thus to doe uppon payne of looseinge his Roome and farther
punnishement at the Kingꝭ pleasure.</p></div>

<p>In this MS. is also to be found an earlier order, of the time
of Edward IV touching the King’s Barber, which is curious, as
indicating that Saturday night was then (as still it is with many)
“tub night” with the King; and we may also infer from the
expression “<i>if</i> it please the King to cleanse his head, legs or feet,”
that it was <i>not</i> a fixed rule for him to do so <i>every</i> Saturday night.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">A Barbour</span> for the Kingis most highe and drad p’son to be taken in this Court,
after that he standeth in degree gentleman yoman or groome. It hath bin much
accustomed to one or two well knowne officers of the Ewrie in housold Daily of
such as bene for the monthe Sergeant or othir. Also we finde how this hath bene used
amonge by a weele betrusted yoman of chambre ffor lacke of cunning of these other
men. It is accustomed that a knight of the Chambre or elles squire of the bodie or
both be p’sent every time when the Kinge wolle shave. This Barbour shall have
every satterday night if it please the Kinge to cleanse his head leggꝭ or feete and for
his shaveing two <span class="nowrap">lovis<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> one pitcher wine. And the usher of chambre ought to testifie
if this be necessary dispensed or not.
</p></div>

<p>It is said that the portrait of Pen was greatly admired by Sir
Robert Peel, who frequently came to the Hall to look at it, and who is
reported to have offered the Company £2,000 for the head, if it might
be cut from the picture, he undertaking to make good the damage!
He is also alleged to have said at one of his visits, that he should like
to sleep on the table at the Hall, so that the first thing he would see
on waking in the morning might be Pen’s head. Had Sir Robert
known the <span class="nowrap">legend<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> of the <i>table</i> he would perhaps have suggested a
different bed. Henry VIII left, by his Will, 100 marks to Pen.</p>

<p>Concerning the next man, Nicholas Alcocke, nothing is known
beyond that he was Surgeon to Edward VI, and was admitted to the<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
freedom in 1523. He was doubtless a member of the Court, though
he never served as Warden.</p>

<p>The last on the front row is Richard Ferris (or Ferrers), Master
in 1563 and Serjeant-Surgeon to Elizabeth. Like others of his
brethren, he also benefited under Henry’s will, to the extent of 100
marks, and was one of the King’s Surgeons.</p>

<p>In the back row are seven figures, but of these the names of
only two survive, viz., William Tylley, Upper Warden 1546, and
Christopher Samon (Salmon, Sammond), admitted to the freedom in
1528, and Master in 1553. By Domestic Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 5,
p. 690, it appears that one Christopher Samon was living in Lombard
Street in 1532: this might be the same man.</p>

<p>29 August, 1668. Dear old Samuel Pepys visited us this day,
and thus records his intentions and opinion concerning the <span class="nowrap">picture&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And at noon comes by appointment Harris to dine with me: and after dinner
he and I to Chyrurgeons Hall, where they are building it new, very fine; and
there to see their theatre, which stood all the fire, and which was our business,
their great picture of Holben’s, thinking to have bought it by the help of Mr.
Pierce<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> for a little money: I did think to give £200 for it, it being said to be
worth £1,000; but it is so spoiled that I have no mind to it, and is not a pleasant,
though a good picture.
</p></div>

<p>James I seems to have entertained a high opinion of this picture,
and borrowed it of us to be copied: his letter applying for it is preserved
at the Hall, and is as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ti0em mb-04em"><span class="smcap">James R.</span></p>

<p>Trustie and welbeloved Wee greete you well. Where we are informed of a
Table of painting in yo<sup>r</sup> Hall wherein is the Picture of o<sup>r</sup> Predecesso<sup>r</sup> of famous memorie
K. Henry the 8<sup>th</sup>, together with diverse of yo<sup>r</sup> Companie, w<sup>ch</sup> being both like him, and<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
well done, Wee are desirous to have copyed. Wherfore o<sup>r</sup> pleasure is that you presently
deliver it unto this bearer Our Welbeloved Servant S<sup>r</sup> Lionell Cranfield Knight, One of
Our Maisters of Requests, whome Wee have commaunded to receave it of you and to see
it w<sup>th</sup> all expedition copied and redelivered safely; and so Wee bid you farewell. Given
at Our Court at Newmarket the 13<sup>th</sup> day of Januarie 1617<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span>
</p></div>

<p>The Court of course agreed to lend the picture, though
doubtless with some misgivings; contrary however to the practice
of the time when money was “lent” to the King, it found its way
back to the Hall.</p>

<p>In 1627, Charles I, a more suspicious borrower than his
father, had it to Whitehall, but here again we fortunately had it
returned.</p>

<p>The Royal College of Surgeons possess some Cartoons, from
which, it has been said, this picture was painted; this is, however, very
doubtful. Some particulars as to these Cartoons may be seen in
Mr. D’Arcy Power’s book, p.&nbsp;96.</p>

<p>In 1734 the Company agreed with Mr. Bernard Baron for him
to engrave the picture for 150 guineas, and several details relating
thereto are recorded in the Minutes. It was published in 1736, and
is a faithful reproduction, much sought after by collectors. Baron has
however copied the picture, exactly as he saw it on to the copperplate,
so that when the impressions were struck off, everything was
reversed. His original study, a red crayon, beautifully executed,
is preserved in the Court Room, and the copperplate is still used,
each Assistant on his election being presented with a copy of
the engraving. The Company also possess a rather rough proof
before letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span></p>

<p>The print is dedicated to the Earl of Burlington, with a Latin
inscription, of which the following is a translation.</p>

<p>“To the Most Noble Lord Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington
and Cork, &amp;c., Knight of the Most Illustrious Order of the Garter.
For the restoration, with the greatest liberality, at his own costs, of
the Anatomical Theatre built a hundred years before, with the
greatest skill, by the very celebrated Architect Inigo Jones, and
decayed by lapse of time. This painting of Holbein representing
the granting of a Charter given with his own hand by Henry VIII,
King of England, &amp;c., to the Society of Surgeons in London and
preserved in their Hall, is by the Society of Surgeons of London
humbly dedicated.”</p>

<p>This inscription, written at a time when the relations between
the Barbers and the Surgeons of the Company were becoming strained,
was evidently drawn by a Surgeon, who coolly ignored the Barbers
throughout.</p>

<p>A very good pen and ink drawing of the picture was made by
Austin Travers Young (aged 16) in 1883, and presented by him to the
Company, for which he received the thanks of the Court.</p>

<p>1537. In “Chapter House Book” B. 1. (at the Record Office)
is a list of the freemen of the several Companies of London at this
date, which gives the names of 2,468 freemen in 39 Companies (an
average of about 63 to each). The Barbers outstripped in numbers all
the others, having a roll of 185 members; next to them came the
Skinners with 151, then the Haberdashers with 120, so on down
to the Bowyers, who mustered but 19. The premier Company,
the Mercers, numbered but 55, whilst the ancient Weavers had
only 30 members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span></p>

<p>The following is the list of our freemen, the first twenty-six
being members of the Court, and Nicholas Symson, Master that year.</p>

<p>1544 and 1545. In <i>Repertory XI</i> (at Guildhall) ff. 73<sup>B.,</sup>
176, 187<sup>B.,</sup> 229<sup>B.,</sup> 232 and 234 are various records relating to
the vexed question of the Barber-Surgeons going on inquests,
bearing armour and serving as constables, from all which
offices they claimed exemption under their Charters and Act of
Parliament.</p>

<p>By the earlier entry, it seems that the Wardens were warned
to appear before the Court of Aldermen to shew cause why they
refused to pass upon inquests, etc.; then came a petition from the
Company praying to be discharged of all offices save the Inquest of
Wardmote once a year; this does not appear to have satisfied the
Authorities, and the Company were directed to draw up further Articles
to be submitted to the Court of Aldermen. Great pressure was no
doubt put upon the Barber-Surgeons, the result being that they<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
abandoned most of the privileges of exemption which they had
claimed, and submitted a Bill of Articles, which was finally approved,
and entered of record on fo. 234. A copy of this lengthy document
is at the Hall, and from it it appears that on the 22nd October,
1545, the Company appeared before the Court of Aldermen as
“humble Besechers” to be shorn of their privileges, the ground
of their petition being “That forasmoche as some grudge and
displeasure is lately sith the unyon and conjunction of their
said ffelowshippes in to one entyre Company growen conteyned
and taken against them and their said ffelowship, by dyverse
of theire neighbours being citezeins of this citie, as they be, by
reason that they your said suppliauntꝭ” are discharged by their
Charters and Act of Parliament from bearing offices, etc., “that
other the Cittzeins of this citie are ellygible and lyable unto,
ffor the whiche grudge and displeasure your besechers are not
a little sorye. ffor the playne declarac͠on thereof and for the
eschewyng advoyding and utter extinguysshement of the said grudge
and displeasure from hensforwarde,” they are content that it shall
be ordained that they shall go upon all Wardmote Inquests, but not
upon any inquests between party and party (<i>i.e.</i>, sit as jurymen in
civil actions); that all freemen of the Company not practising
Surgery shall be contributory to all assessments, serve as Constables
and keep watches in their turn as other citizens, but that all
Surgeons shall be free from bearing armour, etc.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this compromise, entered in the City books,
it seems in course of time to have been overlooked, and, as has
been previously remarked, the exemption of <i>all</i> freemen of the

<p>1550. The first of our Court Minute Books which has been
preserved, commences in the 4<sup>th</sup> Edward VI, and bears this title,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="antiqua">Orders and Awardes</span> made ordered and awarded within the tyme of Maister George
Geen Thomas Johnson Thomas Stocdall and Mathew Johnson Maister and Wardeins of
the Company and fellowship of <span class="smcap">Barbors Surgeons</span> of London for one hole yere begynnyng
the xxvj<sup>th</sup> day of Auguste in the fowerthe yere of the reigne of our Sovereigne Lorde
Kynge Edward the Syxte with thassent and consent of the Assistaunces of the same
Companye as hereafter ensuethe.</p></div>

<p>From this and the succeeding Minute Books, the following
extracts are principally taken as illustrative of the Company’s History
from this period:</p>

<p>1556. At the end of the first book is a very long memorandum
written and signed by Thomas Knot, Master, to the effect that on the
26th March, 1556, he made humble suit to the Lord Mayor, Sir
Will<sup>m.</sup> Garrett and the Aldermen, in the name of the Company, for
the exemption of the Company from finding or setting forth any
soldiers or men of war at any time thereafter, when it might be that
the Citizens of London should be required to do so, either by sea or
land, “fforasmoche as the same Company are alwayes at every such
tyme and tymes very sore burdened and chardged otherwise hereafter
expressed, that is to saye, They are comaunded and bounden to
prepare and fynde so manye Surgeons and so many other men
attendinge upon them at every tyme and tymes that it shall fortune
the King” to send out soldiers by sea or land, and “the same Company
doe alwayes prepare fynde and send furthe for every one houndreth
of suche Souldyers one Surgeon and a man attending upon him.”
Upon which representations the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were
pleased to grant to the Company, that on future occasions when the<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
like requisitions might “fortune to be layed or appointed to or
upon theym, that then they in every suche case upon their gentle
suyte and request made unto the Lorde Mayor and courte of
Aldermen for the tyme beinge for and concernynge their sayd
dischardge for and in consyderac͠on of the causes above remembered,
shalbe as gentelye and charytably holpen eased and
releaved in that behalf as the wayte and ymportaunce of the
burden that the Cytie at every suche tyme shalbe chardged w<sup>th</sup>
all will reasonablye permytt and suffer.”</p>

<p>The memorandum then proceeds to state that the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen advised the Master to cause a remembrance
of the above (being only a promise by word of mouth)
to be entered and recorded in the Book of Ordinances of the
Company, which was done.</p>

<p>1555. In Henry Machyn’s Diary for this year, is the following
reference to a Romish procession, winding up with a dinner
at Barbers’ Hall.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The xxvij day of May was the Clarkes prossessyon from <span class="nowrap">Yerdhall<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> college,

and ther was the blessyd sacrament borne with torche-lyght abowt, and from

</p></div>

<p>1558. This year (8th June) the Company procured an
Inspeximus Charter from Philip and Mary, which is still in our
possession, and has a most beautifully executed title, the initial
letter representing the King and Queen seated on the throne,<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
and the border containing various heraldic badges; the seal
unfortunately is damaged.</p>

<p>It is noticeable in this Charter that the confirmation is to the
Governors of the “Barbers,” and not “Barber-Surgeons,” although the
latter was then the legal style of the Company, but probably this was
another clerical error.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span></p>

<p>1567. Elizabeth inaugurated the first State Lottery in England,
as a means of providing money, and a very peremptory mandate was
directed by the Lord Mayor to the various City Companies, commanding
them to adventure therein.</p>

<p>1st February, 1568. The Barber-Surgeons put in 40<sup>s.</sup> for the
“use, profet and benefyt of the hall,” but did not draw a prize, and
indeed none of the Companies reaped any advantage by the speculation,
the Lottery being simply a trap into which they were ordered to walk.</p>

<p>The proposal for this Lottery was as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A verie rich Lotterie Generall without any Blancks contayning a great No. of
good prices, as well of redy money, as of Plate &amp; certaine sorts of marchaundizes
having been valued &amp; prised by the commaundement of the Queenes most excellent
Majestie by men expert &amp; skilfull and the same Lotterie is erected by hir majesties order,
to the entent that such Commoditie as may chaunce to arise thereof, after the charges
borne, may be converted towards the reparation of the Havens and strength of the
Realme, &amp; towardes such other publique good workes. The No. of lots shall be foure
hundreth thousand, and no more: and every lot shall be the summe of tenne shillings
sterling onely, and no more.</p></div>

<p>Stow says that this Lottery was commenced to be drawn on
the 11th January, 1569, at the West Door of St. Paul’s, and continued
drawing day and night until the 6th May following.</p>

<p>It was a common practice of the Companies to put in their
money under mottoes, and some curious ones are recorded, many
being composed with a quaint sarcasm on the probability of prizes
being obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>

<p>Herbert (Hist. of the Twelve Livery Companies) gives some
interesting particulars of the State Lotteries, and quotes a motto used
by the Merchant Taylors which pretty clearly indicates their opinion
of the business;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="content fs90">
One byrde in the hande is worth two in the wood,<br />
If we get the great lot, it will do us good.<br />
</div></div>

<p>Some of the prizes were ridiculously small, <i>e.g.</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, etc.,
and great dissatisfaction was expressed at the principal prizes remaining
unpaid to the winners.</p>

<p>1573. The Company received a precept from the Lord Mayor
for a “loan” of money to make provision of wheat for the City,
and the same was by the Court ordered to be complied with. This
“corn custom” is very fully treated of by Herbert, and was virtually
a tax upon the companies, who were each rated and compelled to find
a certain proportion of corn to be stored by the City, and sold at such
times as when, there being a scarcity, the markets would otherwise
rise, were it not for the immense stock kept by the City. This custom
survived for many years under certain modifications; as we shall see
hereafter, our Company built a granary in 1633, and stored their
own corn.</p>

<p>The precept above referred to was as <span class="nowrap">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Forasmuche as all comon polecye requyreth the prevenc͠on of extremities, and
consideringe as you knowe the urgent and present necessitie, and the lacke of provision
of wheate and other grayne for furniture of this so great and populous citie, of the want
whereof the queenes ma<sup>tie</sup> and her most honorable coñsell are not ignorant; but havinge
spˀcial regard to the same, are not a lytle offended and displeased, with some grefe
that there bene no better pˀvision heretofore made, and that presentlie the cittie shoulde
be no better stored, by reson wherof the prices of corne and grayne is now muche dearer
in this cittie than in any other parte of this realme, have not only at sundrye times and<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>

duties is, havinge great care and especial consideracion of the same, and pˀcevynge

prices of corne is verry likely to encrease and be advanced to a greater and higher
price than yet is, have thought good and verrye necessarye for the avoyding of
greater inconvenyences, to make immediate pˀvision of a great masse and quantity
of wheate and other grayne, as well w<sup>th</sup>in the realme as beyond the seas for the
provision aforesaid, w<sup>ch</sup> cannot be done w<sup>th</sup>out a great some of money presentlie

<p>The next entry would seem to indicate some contemplated
State interference with the Company’s property, and the answer
was probably not in exact accordance with the truth, for on the
28 May, 1576, a precept in the Queen’s name, having been
received, calling upon the Master and Wardens to return to
class="tal plhir"nt of the revenue of their lands, and of
their goods, <span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>“the answere was that the true revenewe of the
landes was xx<sup>ti</sup> markes whereof the most pˀte went forthe and is
disbursed in peñcons, and that we had no goods.”</p>

<p>1578. A precept was received as follows,</p>

<p>In pursuance of this precept a levy was made upon ninety
freemen, who contributed £19 17<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> (in sums ranging from
1<sup>s</sup> to 6<sup>s</sup> 8<sup>d</sup>) and upon ten “foreins” who paid in all £3. The Expenses
of the soldiers, and their arms, powder, etc., are all set out in detail
(see <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D</a>).</p>

<p>1585. It was agreed “that o<sup>r</sup> Companie by reason of the
often and earnest preceptes from the Lorde maior to move unto some
liberall puttinge in of monie into the Lottery for Armo<sup>r</sup>, that o<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span><sup>r</sup>
Companie should put in x<sup>li</sup> yf that might satisfie for all the Companie
viz<sup>t</sup> the Clothinge vj<sup>li</sup> xiij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d</sup> and the yeomanry v m’kes.”</p>

<p>29th September, 1586. The Lord Mayor had issued sundry
precepts to the Company for the “buyeinge of certein goune powder
amountinge in waight to &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of one Mr. Henry Dale
Hab’dassher at the price of x<sup>d</sup> le ɫi. and yt was agreed the saide
powder should be bought and that Mr. Swaldell [Master, 1593]
should go to chuyse it, and he to have the same powder for viij<sup>d</sup> the
pounde.”</p>

<p>10th March, 1589. It was ordered that the gunpowder
directed by another precept to be provided by the Company, should be
bought and that it should be kept “in the Armorie howse in convenient
place for feare of daunger of ffier.”</p>

<p>29th March, 1596. It was ordered that £40 “ship money”
should be “lent” by the Company to the City, which is the earliest
mention of this obnoxious tax in our books.</p>

<p>8th August, 1596. “Yt was agreed that the som̃e of £xxx<sup>ti</sup>
shalbe lent unto the Cytty for the payenge of Souldiers wages and
other charges diffrayed about the Spanishe voyage.” This was an
Expedition of certain ships (furnished by the City) under the Earl
of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh “to annoye the King of Spaine.”
The English then sacked and burned Cadiz, burnt the Spanish navy,
and on their return home, says Stow, “great triumph was made at
London for their good successe.”</p>

<p>18th August, 1598. At this Court came a precept from the
Lord Mayor, commanding the Company in Her Majesty’s name to
“lend” £100 to the Queen for six months, for suppressing rebels in<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
Ireland. The demand was, as usual, of a most peremptory nature,
and the Court ordered £100 to be paid to the Treasurers appointed
by the City.</p>

<p>6th August, 1599. A precept came from the Lord Mayor in
the Queen’s name, commanding the Master and Wardens to deliver to
the freemen the Company’s armour in “suche order as it maye be, in
safetye readie for her Maiesties service,” whereupon the Master took
for his own use “one muskett fflaske and tuche boxe one headepeece
and one rest.” Eleven other members of the Company had armour
delivered out to them, as “one caliver fflaske and tuche boxe, sworde
and dager girdle and hangers and headepeece.”</p>

<p>1599. A precept was received on 11th November, commanding
the Company to be in attendance on the Queen in her
progress from Chelsea to Westminster, which is not only curious for
the quaintness of its description of the persons who were to be
appointed, but affords a glimpse at the magnificence of Royal processions
three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the above precept the Master with seven other
Members of the Court were appointed to attend, and eight freemen
were nominated as torchbearers.</p>

<p>1600. The fee simple of three houses in Monkwell Street was
this year purchased by the Company of William Fyninge for £112!</p>

<p>11th November, 1600. In obedience to a precept it was
ordered that twelve members of the Court “well mounted on horseback
and apparrelled in all poynts accordingely,” together with twelve
freemen “to wayte uppon them w<sup>th</sup> evˀy one twoe staffe torches in his
hande,” were to meet at the Hall on the following Thursday
(13th November) and to ride with the Lord Mayor to Chelsea to
conduct the Queen to Westminster. This procession is thus referred
to in Stow’s Annals; “On the thirteenth of November 1600, her
Maiestie being most honourablie attended on, by the most honourable
Prelates, and Nobles, and Judges of the Realme, was received neere
unto Chelsey, by the Lord Maior of London, with his brethren the
Aldermen all in Scarlet, besides to the number of five hundred
citizens, in coates of velvet, and chaines of gold, on horesbacke,
every of them having two staffe torches to attende on them: And
they all waited on her, to her royall Pallace at Westminster.”</p>

<p>9th November, 1602. Various members of the Company
“were appoynted to ryde w<sup>th</sup> the M<sup>r</sup> to meete her Ma<sup>tie</sup> on Saterdaie
next” at Chelsea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span></p>

<p>9th April, 1603. A precept was received commanding the
Company to contribute £12 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> towards the cost of the reception
of James I by the City, whereupon an assessment was made upon
the freemen for the same, and the Masters made “choyce of sixe
pˀsonable menn for Wiflers to attend the Livˀye of this Companye
when his Ma<sup>tie</sup> goeth to be crowned.”</p>

<p>20th April, 1603. The following precept requiring the Company
to assist in the reception of the King “in greater number
and more statelie and sumtiows shewe then hath bene at any time
heretofore within the memory of man in the like case pˀformed,”
will be read with interest;</p>

<p>9th August, 1603. James soon attempted to borrow (as he
termed it) of the Companies. “Where a pˀcept was directed to õr
M<sup>rs.</sup> for the lone of money to the Kinge, wee are to answer that wee
have none.”</p>

<p>Perhaps this reply sufficed on this occasion.</p>

<p>22nd October, 1603. London was this year visited with a great
Plague, and in consequence there was no Lord Mayor’s Show.</p>

<p>This xxij<sup>th</sup> of October 1603.</p></div>

<p>7th February, 1604. The Court having considered the many
abuses “comited against the weale of this Company” decided to
apply for an Act of Parliament which should confer upon them
extended powers, and appointed a Committee for the purpose, with
the Recorder and Mr. Wilbraham as counsel.</p>

<p>20th October, 1604. From an entry of this date, it seems that
it had been decided to apply for a fresh Charter, instead of an<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
Act of Parliament, and a summary of the clauses (twenty-seven in
number) which it was desired to have embodied therein is set out
in full. As the Charter was obtained, it is unnecessary to give
these suggested clauses here (they may be seen in Mr. D’Arcy Power’s
book, p.&nbsp;361). The 16th one is, however, curious enough, declaring
the “openinge searinge and imbalmeinge of the dead corpes to be
pˀply belongeinge to the science of Barbery and Surgery, And the
same intruded into by Butchers Taylors Smythes Chaundlors and
others of macanicall trades unskillfull in Barbery or Surgery, And
unseemely and unchristian lyke defaceinge disfiguringe and dismembringe
the dead Corpes, And so that by theire unskillfull searinge
and imbalmeinge, the corpes corrupteth and groweth pˀntlie contagious
and ofensive to the place and pˀsons approachinge.”</p>

<p>30th January, 1605. The Charter of James I is of this date,
but not now in our possession; there are, however, two copies of it at
the Hall, one of which was made in a vellum book in 1658. It was
in Latin of prodigious length; but the following are the clauses as
I make them out, and will suffice for this work.</p>

<p>1. It grants to the Company of Barber-Surgeons that it shall
be ruled by four Masters or Governors and twenty-six Assistants.</p>

<p>2. Power given to the Masters to make lawful assemblies,
to keep Courts in their Common Hall, and therein to consult, counsel
and decree touching their Statutes, Laws and Ordinances, for the
good rule, state and government of the Company.</p>

<p>3. Power to make laws, etc., for the government of the
Masters or Governors, and of all and singular persons using the
mysteries of Barbery or Surgery within the City of London, the
liberties and suburbs thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span></p>

<p>4. Power to punish offenders by penalties, fines, and imprisonments.</p>

<p>5. Fines to be levied by distress by the officers of the
Company.</p>

<p>6. Nomination of John Laycock as Master, and of the
three Wardens.</p>

<p>7. The present Masters to continue in office until the Monday
next before the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, and until
the election of new Masters.</p>

<p>8. The present Masters and Assistants to continue on the
Court for life, unless removed for misbehaviour or other good cause.</p>

<p>9. Upon the death or dismissal of an Assistant, the vacancy
to be filled up by the Court.</p>

<p>10. Assistants to be sworn on admission.</p>

<p>11. The Masters, or the more part of them, to choose twelve
persons of the mystery (six whereof to be expert Surgeons), which
twelve were to be the Electors to choose the new Masters or
Governors on the Monday next before the feast of St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p>12. Of the four Masters, two to be Surgeons.</p>

<p>13. The Masters elected to be sworn to the due execution
of their offices.</p>

<p>14. Any member elected a Governor, to be ever after an
Assistant.</p>

<p>15. If a Governor be dismissed for misconduct, another to be
chosen in his place in the form provided.</p>

<p>16. The twelve Electors to be sworn.</p>

<p>17. Power of search, oversight, reformation, government, and
correction, as well of free as of foreign professors of Barbery and
Surgery in London and its suburbs.</p>

<p>18. Power of entry into Shops of Barbers and Surgeons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span></p>

<p>19. Power to oversee and approve or condemn plasters,
ointments, instruments, etc.</p>

<p>20. Power to examine Barbers and Surgeons.</p>

<p>21. Power to prohibit ignorant persons, or such as shall
wilfully refuse to be examined, from practising.</p>

<p>22. Power to admit skilful persons to practise Surgery.</p>

<p>23. Power to reject and destroy all noxious or improper
medicines, ointments, instruments, etc.</p>

<p>24. The Masters finding on their search any impostors,
ignorant persons, or refusers to be examined, the same to be bound to
their good behaviour.</p>

<p>25. No butcher, tailor, waxchandler or other persons, to cut,
dissect or embalm any dead body, but the same to be done by
members of the Company approved and appointed by the Masters or
Governors of the Barber-Surgeons.</p>

<p>26. The Masters or Governors and admitted Surgeons, to be
discharged from Watch, Ward, Inquests or Juries, and the office
of Constable, and from assessments for the same.</p>

<p>27. Power to purchase lands, etc.</p>

<p>28. Ratification of the old liberties and franchises of the
Barber-Surgeons, and of their lands.</p>

<p>29. All Mayors, Bailiffs, etc., to be aiding and assisting the
Masters or Governors in the execution of their offices.</p>

<p>Christian IV, King of Denmark, brother-in-law of James, paid
a visit to England in 1606, and was sumptuously entertained. In
accordance with the custom of the time, there was a grand pageant and<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
procession in the City, in which all the Companies took part, and
the following precept for the same was received by <span class="nowrap">us;&mdash;</span></p>

</p></div>

<p>Three days after the receipt of the above, came another
precept demanding £5 from the Barber-Surgeons towards the City’s
expenses to be incurred about the Pageant.</p>

<p>The two Kings landed at the Tower, from Greenwich, on
the 31st July, on which day the City gave itself up to the gayest
doings and rejoicings. A curious and interesting description of the
pageant is to be found in a rare tract by H.&nbsp;R., 1606, preserved
at Guildhall Library. Howes also gives an entertaining account of
the proceedings, and relates how the King of Denmark “seriously
observed the unimaginable number of gallant Ladies, beauteous
virgins, and other delicate Dames filling the Windowes of every
houss with kinde aspect saluting” him as he passed by. He also
tells us of the melodious harmony, the Latin speech, the pastoral
device, and the fountains which ran with wine, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span></p>

<p>It seems that on this great occasion one of the Marshalls had
endeavoured to take our Company “down a peg” in order of
precedence. This was, however, successfully resisted, and the Clerk
proudly records the following in the Minutes on the same day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Memorand</span>: that the Kingꝭ ma<sup>tie</sup> w<sup>th</sup> the Kinge of Denmarke &amp; the Prince
of Wales came through this Cittie from wardes the Tower of London attended uppon

standingꝭ would have displaced us But by the Lord maiors order wee were placed in the
seaventeenth place accordinge as wee ought to be placed.</p></div>

<p>1606. Notwithstanding the new charter granted in the
previous year, the Court found itself unable to regulate the practice
of Barbery and Surgery without an extended set of By-Laws, which
were now obtained and are still preserved at the Hall. They are
in English, on eight large skins of parchment, beautifully engrossed
with a handsomely illuminated title, the initial <img src="images/text-t.png" width="15" height="16" class="mb-02em" alt="" /> containing the
Barber-Surgeons’ arms, and distributed over the heading are the
arms of the Master and Wardens in 1606, viz.: John Peck, Edward
Rodes, William Fynynge and John Fenton.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/img021.jpg" width="480" height="125" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The By-Laws are allowed by Thomas Lord Ellesmere,
Lord Chancellor; Thomas Earl of Dorset, Lord Treasurer; and
Sir John Popham, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; who
send “greeting in our Lord God Everlasting,” and enact Ordinances of<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
such fearful length, that to a layman it passes comprehension how the
draughtsman could have kept his head clear whilst he travelled through
such a sea of prolixity, and, to a great extent useless, repetition. If
the Chancellor and his colleagues troubled themselves to read through
and understand the document to which they have appended their
seals, they must have uttered very sensible sounds of relief when
they came to the sealing; the recapitulation of the mere heads of
this extraordinary production, will probably be found wearisome to
the reader, viz<sup>t</sup>:</p>

<p>This Court Room was built within the circular Bulwark at

<p>1608. The Colony of Virginia (so named from the Virgin
Queen Elizabeth, in whose reign it was discovered) was in an
unsatisfactory condition by reason of its scanty population, want of
enterprise and other causes; whereupon the Council of Virginia
endeavouring the prosperity of the Colony, sent a letter to the
Lord Mayor propounding a scheme of emigration and colonisation
to be undertaken by the City, which should ease the Metropolis “of a
swarme of unnecessarie inmates,” make the fortunes of the emigrants<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
(and of the “undertakers”) and benefit the Colony. This letter
is so interesting that no apology is necessary for reproducing it here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The City took up the scheme heartily, a large sum was
subscribed and a great number of emigrants crossed the water. The
Barber-Surgeons invested £25, but never received anything for
it again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>23rd March, 1609. This daye it is ordered that the pˀnt M<sup>rs</sup> shall advent<sup>r</sup>

<p>6th January, 1609. In obedience to a precept from the Lord
Mayor, £10 was paid to the Chamberlain, towards the construction
of a Garner for the use of the City.</p>

<p>25th May, 1610. A precept came from the Lord Mayor
calling upon the Company “to be readie in yo<sup>r</sup> bardge well and
richlie sett forthe before vii of the clocke in the morning” on
the 31st January, to go to Chelsea to meet the eldest son of James I,
on which occasion he was to go from Richmond to Whitehall to
be created Prince of Wales; whereupon the following minute is
<span class="nowrap">recorded:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this Court a precept beinge sent from my lord Maior unto this Company
w<sup>ch</sup> beinge at this Court read, the effect whereof was that our Company on Thursdaie

Citie in the enterteynement of the high &amp; mightie prince at Chelsey. It was<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
ordered that none of the Company shold be warned for this service but onely those w<sup>ch</sup>
ware of the Assistaunce of the Clotheinge to goe in the Barge, the reason thereof
is that a barge cold not be gotten large enough to carry the whole lyvery.</p></div>

<p>1611. In this year came a precept from the Lord Mayor,
by authority of the King, complaining of “the abuse growing by
excesse and straunge fashions of apparell, used by manye apprentises,
and by the inordynate pryde of mayde servaunts and women servaunts
in their excesse of apparell and follye in varietie of newe fashions,
and to admonish them to have a due and speciall care to see a
spedye reformac͠on had in everye one of their servaunts.” What
effect this had upon the apprentices and servants of the Barber-Surgeons
we are not told, but doubtless they were properly
admonished.</p>

<p>1st July, 1614. A precept was received to the effect that
the King had determined to borrow £100,000 of the City, and
that the Barber-Surgeons were assessed at £600 towards this loan,
which they were to lend, or which they were coolly informed they
could compound for, by an absolute fine of £30! As the Court
well knew that they would never again see a halfpenny of the £600
if lent, they quickly and wisely determined to pay the £30.</p>

<p>Profiting by past experience, the next extracts show that the
Court proceeded warily in the matter of “adventuring” in the State
Lottery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>29th April, 1614. Att this Court the M<sup>r</sup> propounding how they had receaved
Letters from the Lordꝭ of the privy Councell and from the lord Maior thereby exhorting
&amp; intreating them to call their assistauntes together and to admonishe the genˀall
body to be adventurers in the great lottery w<sup>ch</sup> is comyng forth, Whereupon the same
lrẽs being considered on at this Court, it is thought fitt and ordered that the M<sup>rs</sup>
shall att their pleasures call together the body of the Company, and they being gathered
together, to admonish &amp; pˀswade them to be adventerers in the same Lottery.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span></p>

<p>17th October, 1614. The Court having collected a sum of
money for the Lottery, it was ordered that it should not be paid to
the Treasurer, Sir Thos. Smith, until the Company shall be “assured”
by a Bill of Adventure under seal “for their adventure unto virgynia,
as also that it shalbe published in print certeynelie when the lotterey
shalbe drawen.”</p>

<p>The College of Physicians had been for many years very
jealous as to the Barber-Surgeons trespassing on their preserves,
and as far back as 12th November, 1595, wrote a long letter to
their “verie loving freends” the Master and Wardens, cautioning
the members of the Company against practising physic, and stating
that no few of them were culpable in the matter, but that the
College had hitherto forborne to molest or punish them; the letter
continues, “but for that we now see by daily experience that upon
our lenetie and sufferance this inconvenience more and more
increaseth, insomuch that both in credit and otherwise, it seemeth
to touch us more neere than well can be indured; We have therefore
thought it good to put you in mynd thereof, and therewithal earnestly
and freendlie to request you, that among yourselves some such
discreet order may be taken heerin, that the like offence hereafter
maie not be committed by them or any of theirs. Wherein if we
shall perceave you as ready to fulfil our honest request, as we are
willing to maintain good amytie and concord with you and your
Companie, we wilbe very glad thereof and geve you thanks therefore.
If not, then as we are fully minded to defend our privileges and to deal
with the particular offendors therein, as order of law and our ordinances
in that behalf requireth; so we trust the body of your Societie will not
be offended therewith. And so we bid you most hartelie farewell.”</p>

<p>The above letter is taken from Dr. Goodall’s History of the
College of Physicians. Dr. Goodall gives several instances of Barber-<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>Surgeons
and Apothecaries being fined or imprisoned for practising
physic; and, indeed, there seems to have been a strife waging between
the College and the Company for a long period.</p>

<p>1617. The Physicians in 15 James I obtained a Charter
confirming their Charter of 10 Henry viij, with several additional
privileges and clauses in restraint of the privileges of the Barber-Surgeons,
who thereupon petitioned the King that that Charter might
not be confirmed by Act of Parliament, as the Physicians were
desirous that it should be. The King on 4th February, 1620, ordered
that the petitioners should be left to seek any lawful remedy either
in Parliament or otherwise, as they might be advised, and accordingly
on 23rd April, 1624, they presented a petition to the House of
Commons, who ordered that the Physicians’ Patent should be brought
into the Committee of Grievances, and both parties heard by Counsel,
the consequence of which was that the Physicians proceeded no
further with their Bill.</p>

<p>1632. Later on the Physicians endeavoured again to obtain
a supremacy over the Barber-Surgeons, and on 13th June, 1632,
procured an Order in Council which made it incumbent upon Surgeons
in certain serious and specified cases of Surgery, to call in a
“learned Physitian,” and to enforce this order they procured the
Attorney General to exhibit a Bill in the Star Chamber in which
the obnoxious clause was inserted, but on a Petition of the Barber-Surgeons
complaining of the injury that would thereby accrue not only
to themselves, but to the public, the King, by an Order of Court
dated 22nd July, 1635, directed the clause to be struck out.</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the Physicians again endeavoured to
procure an Act of Parliament confirming their Charter, whereupon the
Barber-Surgeons claimed to have a clause inserted in the Act in the<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
nature of a proviso that nothing therein contained should be construed
to the prejudice of their privileges, and again the Physicians seem
to have been checkmated, for they allowed their proposed Act to
fall through.</p>

<p>Kings’ Barbers and Kings’ Surgeons seem to have secured
substantial benefits from their official positions, as the following notices
(from Domestic State Papers at the Record Office) testify.</p>

<p>25th August, 1625. There is a letter of this date from Sir
James Fullerton to Secretary Conway, intimating that it is His
Majesty’s pleasure to grant to Michael Andrews (Master 1635 and
King’s Surgeon) a pension of £150 per annum for life.</p>

<p>17th December, 1625. And at this date is a grant to Thomas
Caldwell (Master 1627 and King’s Barber).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A graunt to Thomas Caldwell esq<sup>r</sup> his Mat<sup>s</sup> servant of ye som̃e of one thousand

<p>In addition to stray grants like the above, the perquisites and
fees attaching to the Office of King’s Barber were very lucrative, and
Mr. Caldwell must have done exceedingly well out of the following
stroke of business.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>January, 1626. Whereas his Ma<sup>tie</sup> hath bene pleased to appoint Mr. Thomas

<p class="fl0 mt5em">Mr. Caldwell does not appear to have left his widow well

<p>1624 and 1625. In the minutes of this period are constant
notices of the “visitation,” and of “the contagious tyme.” The Plague
raged with great severity in London in 1625, and it is said that over
40,000 died of it in the year. The Company appear to have been
very liberal in their gifts of money to any who had the least claim
upon them, the relief being frequently stated to have been given by
“reason of the hardnes of the tymes.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>11th April, 1625. This daye the pˀcept for provision of corne sent unto o<sup>r</sup>
Companie by the lord Maio<sup>r</sup> of london was here read in Courte, And this Courte is
fullie resolved that the present M<sup>rs</sup> doe give unto the Lord Maio<sup>r</sup> and returne him this
answeare that the Companie is provided of their proportion of corne and more they
are not able to provide or receive into their charge.</p></div>

<p>1628. This year the Company were compelled to “lend”
the King £360, which they with great difficulty raised, the greater
part being borrowed at interest to enable them to do so. They
also paid £30 towards a “present” (?) of £5,000 given by the
City to the Palsgrave (Frederick, Prince Elector Palatine, son-in-law
of James I).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span></p>

<p>15th August, 1629. On this day was sealed the Company’s
new Charter from Charles I. It is in Latin on five large skins
of parchment with the Great Seal of England pendant. There
is a portrait of the King with a stiletto beard in the initial
letter, and an ornamental heading along the top of the first
skin. This Charter ratifies that of James I, directs that public
lectures on Surgery shall be given, and confirms and somewhat
varies the old regulations for the governance of the practitioners of
that science.</p>

<p>22nd October, 1629. The Company evidently began now
to kick at the numerous demands made upon its purse by the
authorities, for a precept coming from the Lord Mayor demanding
£12 10<i>s.</i> contribution towards a pageant, it was ordered that it
be not paid until the Court was satisfied that it could be legally
demanded, and enquiry made as to whether or no other Companies
had paid similar contributions.</p>

<p>1632. The fabric of old St. Paul’s being in a lamentable
state of decay, the celebrated Archbishop Laud wrote a letter
to the Barber-Surgeons asking a contribution towards its
repair. Ever ready to assist in good works, the Company
cheerfully devoted a very considerable sum towards that object,
notwithstanding the comparative poverty to which they had been
reduced (in consequence of the grievous impositions made upon them
by the authorities in the shape of forced loans and other unconstitutional
demands). Moreover, they recorded their benefaction, in a
delightfully expressed minute, which will be found at the end of
the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1633. This year the Company built a granary at the Hall,
for the store of Corn.</p>

<p>12th July, 1633. A new set of By-Laws was framed and
allowed by the proper authorities. These are extant on twelve
great skins of parchment, more wordy and of greater length than
those of 4th James I! They are, however, very similar to those,
with technical alterations and amendments here and there, and
provision is made for Lectures on Surgery, demonstrations of anatomy,
and for the better Examination of Surgeons. Clause 19 provides
that any freemen of the mystery who shall use any arts, trades or
sciences other than Surgery “shall be accepted, reputed, adjudged
and taken for Barbars.” Empirics and impostors were to be rigorously
dealt with, and the Court was to have supervision over <i>all</i> Navy
Surgeons, their chests, medicines and instruments. No Barbers or
Surgeons were to be impressed for the Navy without license of the
Court, and numerous regulations were made for the government of
the Company.</p>

<p>The document is signed by Richard Earl of Portland, Lord
Treasurer; Sir Thomas Richardson and Sir Robert Heath, the Lords
Chief Justices; the seals of the first two are still pendant, but that of
Sir Robert Heath is missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span></p>

<p>1636. Spurred into further action for the advancement of the
science of Surgery, which their extended powers under the new
By-Laws had conferred upon them, the Company determined upon
building a Theatre for the delivery of Lectures, and for anatomical
purposes, etc. This they set about in 1636, employing the great
Inigo Jones as their Architect, who about this period also designed and
carried out the present beautiful Court Room or Parlour, one of the

<div class="blockquot">

<p>11th February, 1636. Upon the moc͠on of o<sup>r</sup> M<sup>r</sup> to this Court concerneing the
want of a publique Theater for Anatomycall exercises and Sceletons and a lesser roome
for private discections, This Court doth order that if the M<sup>rs</sup> or Governo<sup>rs</sup> upon their
petic͠on to the Lord Maio<sup>r</sup> and Aldrẽn they have the bullwarke &amp; long stripp of ground
lieing betwixt the gould smiths tenement &amp; clothw: tenemtꝭ &amp; london wall at the
one end &amp; the Companies hall &amp; pˀlor &amp; london wall at the other end, by purchase
in fee farme or a long lease from the Cittie, that then a Theater to the largenes of
the upper ground betwixt the goldsmithes tenem̃t &amp; the clothworkers tenem<sup>t</sup> on the one
side &amp; london wall on the other side shalbe be ovally built for the <span class="nowrap">Wor̃p<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> and
comiditie of this Companie at the Charge of this house.
</p></div>

<p>The piece of ground on which it was proposed to erect the
Theatre was then on lease to the Company from the City. The
Lease was dated 29th March, 7 Charles I (1631), and made between
the Mayor, &amp;c., of London, of the one part and the Masters, &amp;c.,
of the Barber-Surgeons, of the other part. In consideration of
£20 paid by the Company the City leased to them <span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>lwark and the houses Roomes and buildings therein or thereupon
made or erected, And all that ground or garden plott with
thappurtenñces scituat lyinge and beinge in the parish of St Olave
in Silver Street in the Citie of London next unto the Wall of the
same Citie there of the one side, and the landes of the saide Maisters
or Governors and others on the other side late in the tenure or Pg157  Pg158  Pg159
occupac͠on of the right honoro<sup>ble</sup> Henry late Lord Wyndsor deceased
or of his assignes and now in the tenure or occupac͠on of the said
Maisters,” etc., from the feast of the Annunciation, 1631, for forty-one
years at a rent of £3. The lease contained the usual covenants of a
repairing lease, as also one “that neither they the saide Masters
or Governors their successors nor assigns shall or will att any time
or times during the said Terme suffer any Inmate or Inmates
to dwell in any part of the premises afore demised.”</p>

<p>5th May, 1636. There is an Indenture of Lease of this date
made between the Mayor, &amp;c., of London, and the Masters, &amp;c.,
of the Barber-Surgeons, which after reciting the last mentioned
lease proceeds: “And whereas the said Maisters or Governors of
the Misterie and Comonaltie of Barbars and Surgians of London
for the better enhableing of them in the Arte of Surgerie Doe intend
to erect and build a decent Roome or Theatre on part of the premisses
for the keeping therein A learned and constant Lecture in the
Theorie and practiqʒ partꝭ of Surgerie As also to pˀforme their
publique operac͠ons of Anatomies and other exercises thereunto
belonging, Which will be verie chargeable to them Wherein the
said Maior and Cominaltie and Citizens are desirous and willinge to
aide and further the saide Maisters or Governors in the setting forward
of soe necessarie and comendable a worke tendinge to the generall
good of the whole kingdome,” wherefore the Mayor, &amp;c., leased the
said premises to the Company for a further term of 200 years upon the
expiry of the lease then running, at the same rent of £3 per annum, the
Lessees covenanting to build the Theatre within seven years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>16th May, 1636. Upon o<sup>r</sup> M<sup>rs</sup> report to this Court that the Lord Maio<sup>r</sup> &amp;
Aldrẽn have freely graunted to this house a new lease of CC yeares comenceing
from the expirac͠on of o<sup>r</sup> lease now in being It is ordered with the generall consent
of the whole Court here present that the Theater shalbe proceeded in and built
according to the plotts drawne by his Ma<sup>t</sup>ꝭ Surveigher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span></p>

<p>3rd August, 1636. It is ordered by this Court that the Companies Armes with
Helmett Crest supporters and mantlings shalbe sett up in Portland Stone under the
Cantilaver does of the Theater being over the Windowe next the Granarye.</p>

<p>Alsoe the mottoe viz<sup>t.</sup> <span class="smcap">Speciosum hoc Theatrum Anatomicum erectñ fuit
Michaele Andrews Chirurgo Regio ac comunioni BarbitonsoꝜ et ChirurgoꝜ pˀ
tempore præfecto, Guardianis vero Joanne Warde Nicolas Heath et Wilhelmo
Huckle anno ab exhibito in carne Messiæ supra millesimum sexcentesimum
trigesimo sexto</span> shalbe engraven in the voyde stone worke over the greate doore into
the Theater.</p></div>

<p>A plan of the Theatre is preserved in a collection of the
works of Inigo Jones, at Worcester College, Oxford, and a short
description of it is found in Hatton’s New View of London, 1708.
The curiosities in the Barber-Surgeons’ museum of those days will
excite a smile when compared with the collection now at Lincoln’s
Inn Fields. Hatton says that the Theatre was built in “an elliptical
form, and commodiously fitted up with four degrees of seats of cedar
wood, and adorned with the figures of the seven liberal sciences, and
the twelve signs of the zodiac. Also containing the skeleton of an
ostrich, put up by Dr. Hobbs, 1682, with a busto of King Charles I.
Two humane skins on the wood frames, of a man and a woman,
in imitation of Adam and Eve, put up in 1645; a mummy skull,
given by Mr. Loveday, 1655. The sceleton of Atherton with copper
joints (he was executed) given by Mr. Knowles in 1693. The figure
of a man flead, where all the muscles appear in due place and
proportion, done after the life. The sceletons of Cambery Bess
and Country Tom (as they then call them), 1638; and three other
sceletons of humane bodies.”</p>

<p>Hogarth has, in ghastly style depicted the dissection of a
criminal in this Theatre, in which the skeletons above referred to
are seen in niches in the wall.</p>

<div><p class="ti0em tac fs85">ESTATE IN MONKWELL STREET</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span></p>

<p>The plan of the Company’s Estate, has been kindly supplied
for this work by Mr. Charles John Shoppee, as surveyed by him
in 1869, previous to the demolition of the old Livery Hall, Kitchen,
etc. The Theatre had been pulled down in 1784, and houses erected
on its site; the Theatre is, however, shewn upon this plan, as being
more interesting than the houses which supplanted it. In 1636 the
Company commenced the erection of the Livery Hall and present
Court Room, the work being carried out from the designs and under
the superintendence of the celebrated Inigo Jones, the Livery Hall
was, however, burnt in 1666, and that shown upon the plan is the
one which was erected after the Great Fire.</p>

<p>5th September, 1636. The Plague was again abroad in
London, and the Court, for fear of infection by meeting together,
resolved as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In regard of the now greate visitac͠on of the plague This Court doth
deferre the Courts for the daye of Rules the Vew daye &amp; other publique Courts
till it shall please God to cease the Sicknes.</p></div>

<p>23rd September, 1636. The Lord Mayor having requested
the Company to nominate “twoe Surgians to take care of those
that were infected with the plague in this Cittie &amp; liberties,” the
Court thought that two was a wholly insufficient number and
nominated six Surgeons to be presented to the Court of Aldermen.</p>

<p>2nd October, 1636. £5 was ordered to be paid in to the
Chamber of London towards the relief of the poor, stricken with
the Plague.</p>

<p>30th March, 1637. The Company were assessed to pay £10
“ship money,” whereupon an order was made that they should
forbear to pay it, and a Committee appointed to wait on the Court<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
of Aldermen to petition against the assessment. The application
was, however, unsuccessful, as by an Order of Court, 29th March,
1638, the money was directed to be paid.</p>

<p>8th November, 1638. The Court of Aldermen having assessed
the Company to furnish 80 quarters of corn in lieu of 60 as heretofore
provided, it was resolved to petition against it. This would
be a very important matter to the Company as the assessments
for all public purposes were made upon the City Companies <i>pro
rata</i> with their corn quarterages, and if the 80 quarters were allowed
to stand, it would raise all the future assessments 33 per cent. The
result however, of the protest does not appear in the minutes.</p>

<p>28th October, 1640. On receipt of a precept from the Lord
Mayor, it was ordered that three barrels of Gunpowder should be
bought and stored.</p>

<p>1640. The Company unwillingly agreed to lend the King
£400, and were put to great inconvenience in raising the money, which
was required by Charles for his campaign in Scotland.</p>

<p>After several skirmishes with the Scots, the English Army
was at length disbanded, and the King went himself to Scotland
to negotiate the difference which had arisen by his attempted interference
in Church matters in that Kingdom; he returned to London in
November, 1641, and the following minute refers to the preparations
made by our Company to meet him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>22nd November, 1641. Upon reading the Lord Maiors precepts for the
Companyes enterteyning the King upon his returne from Scotland It is ordered
that the Ma<sup>r</sup> and Wardens, Mr. Serjeant Clowes, Mr. Richard Wateson, Mr. Woodall,
Mr. Powell, Mr. Burgin, Mr. Heath, Mr. Henry Wateson, Mr. Bignall, Mr. Dye,
Mr. Arris, Henry Boone, and Thomas Turner, shalbe attendant on Twesday next well
mounted on Horseback in plush or Velvett with Chaines of Gold, and that John Perkins<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
shall beare the Pendon with our Coate of Armes on Horseback and that these 18 ffree
men shalbe Decently cladd in the Companyes Colours of White and Greene, each of
them with a greene flatt Cap with a white Ribbon about it, a greene Cassock and
Drawers of the same Stuffe Whiffler like laced with a white Lace a white ribaning and
a greene Ribbin athwart theire Brests, and each of them a Truncheon in theire hands
in the forenoone, and in the aftˀnoone each of them 2 Torches, and these 18 to attend
perticulerly one of them to each of the Horsemen, viz<sup>t.</sup></p></div>

<p>(Then follows a list of the freemen chosen.)</p>

<p>The “Riding out” on this occasion must have been a
magnificent sight, if all of the Companies spent proportionately to
the outlay of ours, which was no less than £39 17<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> upon
decorations, etc., for those taking part in the procession. Strype
informs us <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Lord Mayor on horesback wearing a gown of crimson velvet &amp; a collar of
SS, and attended by his suite, rode in the front of the procession to meet the King.
Then followed the Aldermen in scarlet gowns and the City council and chief officers
in black gowns. Upon reaching Moorfields, there waited in a readiness to attend his
Lordship and the service, about five hundred horsemen selected out of the Liveries
of the several Companies, being Masters, Wardens, and prime men of each Company
in velvet or plush coats and suits, with chains of gold, being well horsed and gallantly
furnished, every Company having a horseman in the front carrying a pendant with that
Company’s arms to which he did belong (for distinction sake), and a footman to attend
each horseman of the Livery with truncheons and torches as before, both horsemen with
the pendants and footmen being suited cap-a-pee with the Company’s colours on
which they waited. There were also fourteen Trumpeters, with trumpets, banners and
scarfs, who were placed two between every hundred of the horse, and four at the
head of the troop. The procession moved on to Kingsland, where the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen and the Companies awaited the Kings approach, while the Sheriffs
attended by seventy-two men in Scarlet Cloaks trimmed with silver lace (the colours
of the City) with javelins and feathers and four trumpeters, rode as far as Stamford Hill,
and there met their Majesties and escorted them to Kingsland.</p>

<p>His Majesty was accompanied by the Queen, the Prince, the Duke of York,
the Princess Mary and the Prince Elector Palatine, and after receiving an address,<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
the Royal party joined the civic procession to London, entering it at Moorgate,
and proceeded through London Wall, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill and Cheapside,
to the banquet at Guildhall, amidst the City Companies in their formalities and stands
on each side of the streets, the City conduits running with a diversity of wines.</p></div>

<p>1643. The relations between the King and the City having
become estranged in the fearful distractions of these times, Charles
endeavoured to conciliate the citizens with a message, which was
publicly read at Guildhall on the 13th January, and later on he
sent a circular letter to the Masters of the several Companies requiring
them to call their freemen and apprentices together, to read to them
a copy of a letter which he had sent to the City on the 17th January.
The Court of the Barber-Surgeons met on Tuesday, 24th inst.,
and cautiously record that they would have summoned their freemen
for the next day, but that it was a fast day and that in the interim
an order had come from the Committee of Safety that the letter, etc.,
should not be read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>24th January, 1643. The Kings Letter sent to the M<sup>rs</sup> &amp; Wardens of this
Company was read in Court and the printed Letter in it and the Cittyes Petic͠on and
his Ma<sup>ties</sup> gracious answer unto it. And but that the morrow was fast day being the
last Wednesday in this Moneth the ffreemen and apprentices of this Company could not
be summoned to appeare then, it should have bin read. Soe that in the Interim an
Order of Comand from the Lords and Comõns was directed to this Company to
countermaund the said Letters in these words,</p>

<p>Die Martis 24<sup>to</sup> Januarii, <span class="nowrap">164 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">2</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span>. At the Comittee of Lords and Comõns for

<p>Whereas there are divers Letters pretended to be sent by his Ma<sup>tie</sup> to the
M<sup>rs</sup> and Wardens of the severall Halls in the city of London with Two litle Bookes

Comõns of the City of London to his Ma<sup>tie.</sup> And the other intituled his Ma<sup>ties</sup> Letter

order therein. And the M<sup>rs</sup> and Wardens of every Hall are required to bring the

<p>17th January, 1644. It is ordered that in respect of the greate troubles and
distractions of these times there shalbe noe publique Anatomy this yeare dissected.</p></div>

<p>1644. The Company seem to have become greatly impoverished
by the venture in Ireland, the rebuilding of their premises,
and the forced loans to the King and the Parliament. In a
certificate given by the Master and Wardens (5th September, 1644)
to be produced in a suit in which they were defendants, they state
that their debts are £3,000, and that they can get no return of
any of the money lent for public purposes, or even the interest of it.</p>

<p>If the Stuarts acted in an unconstitutional manner in their
oppressive demands upon the Companies, the Roundheads were as
bad, with just this difference, that, with all their pretensions to
purity, piety and high-mindedness, they did not hesitate to practise
actual dishonesty in their <i>modus operandi</i> of squeezing the Companies,
as the following painful incident from our books testifies:&mdash;The
Company had borrowed from Mr. Richard Wateson, one of the
Assistants, £1,200 upon sealed bonds, for the express purpose of
meeting the demands which had been made upon them by the King
and Parliament from time to time. Mr. Wateson having been
declared a “Papist and Delinquent,” his property was seized, and
the Bonds of the Barber-Surgeons, found in his strong chest, were
taken to the Committee for Gloucester and Hereford, sitting at<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
Grocers’ Hall. These worthies, in conjunction with the Committee
for Sequestrations, came down upon the Company and demanded
payment of the £1,200 for which they had given their bonds to
their brother, Mr. Wateson. The Court deeming this a monstrous
piece of injustice, hesitated to comply, whereupon the Committees
threatened to seize the Company’s entire estate; and then the Court
resolved to petition Parliament, but the House not sitting for some
time the petition could not be prosecuted, and the Committee being
urgent, the Company most reluctantly agreed to pay down £400
and to have the bonds cancelled. Although these shameful terms
were definitely agreed upon, the Committees a few days later broke
faith, demanding £400 cash and the Company’s bond for another
£100, to which the Company, like the lamb with the wolf at its
throat, <i>nolens volens</i>, consented. The iniquity of this business was
made apparent to the Committees, who were well aware that the
Company had incurred the debt to Mr. Wateson in order to meet
the previous rapacity of themselves, and yet they hesitated not
to compel the Company to submit to a further fine of £500 for
having complied with their demands in the past, besides manifesting
the dishonesty proposed by them in offering to cancel the debt due by
the Company to Mr. Wateson.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>29th April, 1645. By the power and authority to this Court given by severall
Orders of a late Court of Assistants, this Court for and towards the raiseing of the
400<sup>li</sup> agreed to be paid in part of the composic͠on for Mr. Watson’s debt unto the
the Comittee for the releife of Gloucester, &amp;c., did pawne all the Companyes plate
both guilt and white, weighing 1,120&nbsp;oz. <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span> or thereabouts, unto Mary Crosse of London
Widdow for the Sum̃ of 280<sup>li</sup> by a Writeing of Bargaine and Sale this day sealed
with this Companyes Com̃on Seale bearing date the 16<sup>th</sup> day of this Instant Aprill with
a provisoe of Redempc͠on. And borrowed of Mr. George Dunn 100<sup>li</sup> more at Interest
at vj<sup>li</sup> 10<sup>s</sup> pˀ annum pˀ centum for w<sup>ch</sup> he tooke the secureity of our Com̃on Seale.</p></div>

<p>A few years later on (14th September, 1648), Mr. Edward
Arris presented to the Court a letter from Mr. Wateson, wherein was<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
intimated that he expected the Company to repay him the money
borrowed, the bonds for which had been seized by Cromwell’s party,
and for which the Company had already compounded, whereupon we
read “This Court doth declare theire acknowledgement of a great
respect and esteeme they have and beare towards him and shalbe
ready to doe him all the right they can without prejudicing the
Company”; and again on 30th April, 1650, “Mr. Richard Wateson
an ancient M<sup>r</sup> of this Company Doth this day desire to know the
mind of this Court concerning the 1,200<sup>li</sup> by him lent to this
Company and sequestred in this Company’s hands and compounded
ffor 500<sup>li</sup> in full of principall and Interest, The matter being of great
Consequence, this Court doth take time to consider of it and to give
him an answer therein.”</p>

<p>What answer Mr. Wateson got, I do not know; he was held
in great esteem by the Company, and doubtless some honourable
compromise was arranged.</p>

<p>In their negotiations with the Committees, the Company
seem to have been able to impress the Chairman favourably on
certain occasions, though there is grave reason to apprehend that
this official of the party of purity was open to a bribe, as the following
minutes would seem to indicate.</p>

<p>27th October, 1645. The Company having been threatened
with sequestration of their entire estate unless an assessment made
upon them was paid on Friday following, a Committee of the Court
was ordered to wait on Mr. Scawin, the Chairman of the Committee
for the Army, to beg his favourable consideration of the Company’s
poor estate; the result is seen in the next entry.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>14th September, 1648. This Court takeing notice of the greate Love and ffavour
of Mr. Scawin Chaireman to the Comittee ffor the Army expressed oftentimes upon<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
severall occasions towards our Company Doth thinke fitt in gratitude and accordingly
doth order That the present Governours doe present to him a guift of the value of
vj<sup>li</sup> 13<sup>s</sup> 4<sup>d</sup> The quality and price of the guift is left to theire discretions.</p></div>

<p>1646. To relieve them of their great debts, the Company
about this period raised considerable sums by granting annuities;
the following are examples in <span class="nowrap">point:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>24th March, 1646. This day M<sup>r</sup> Nicholas Heath payd the sum of 200<sup>li</sup> to the
use of this Company and is the purchase money for an Annuity of 26<sup>li</sup> pˀ añn. for
10 yeares to himselfe and Grace his Wife Whereupon the Deed of Grant of the said
Annuity was sealed with the Com̃on Seale and delivered to theire use.</p>

<p>Alsoe this day M<sup>ris</sup> Elizabeth ffreeman payd the sum of 200<sup>li</sup> the Purchase
money for the like Annuity of 26<sup>li</sup> pˀ añn. for 10 yeares and the Deed for that purpose
was sealed and delivered to her.</p></div>

<p>On the 30th January, 1649, the King’s troubles were ended by
his murder, and very shortly afterwards we find this significant minute.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>19th March, 1649. This Court doth order That the Oath conteyned in the
Rules and Ordinances of this Company be administred unto every ffreeman upon his
admission as before, The ffirst Words which doe concerne allegiance to the King
and his Successors only to be left out.</p></div>

<p>The banners of the Company bearing the late King’s arms
were destroyed, and any heraldic insignia at the Hall which contained
the Royal Arms were ordered to be defaced. We may readily believe
that this was most unwillingly done by the Court, who however,
had no option in the matter.</p>

<p>1648–9. Fairfax had filled the City with troops, “billetting
orders” being made upon the several Companies for the reception
of the soldiers at their Halls. Herbert (Vol. I, p.&nbsp;181) states that
the Merchant Taylors were fortunate enough to procure an order
of exemption which cost them £20 10<i>s.</i>, and further that he believed
their case to be unique, but it seems that the Carpenters by means<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
of “Gratuities ‘to sevˀall men of qualitie,’” amounting to £13 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
managed to get free of this imposition, whilst the Barber-Surgeons
procured their immunity at a much cheaper rate, for we read in
the Wardens’ accounts of the period,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Paid fforr the charges expended in procureing a Protecc͠on from the Lord
General from quartering Souldiers in the hall 13<sup>s</sup> 3<sup>d.</sup></p></div>

<p>These notices are clear indications that Cromwell and the
“men of qualitie” about him, were accustomed to take bribes.</p>

<p>3rd February, 1654. The City entertained Cromwell at
Grocers’ Hall, and our Company had to go out in procession to
receive him, our “standing” being in St. Paul’s Churchyard.</p>

<p>1660. The Barber-Surgeons contributed £96 towards a
present of £10,000 given by the City to Charles II at the
Restoration. No money exacted under precept was more willingly
paid than this, and indeed the Companies generally seemed to have
cheerfully contributed, delighted to have escaped the gloom of the
Commonwealth, and with a prospect of brighter times in store. On
the 5th July, the King was nobly entertained at Guildhall, our
Company taking part in the rejoicings (see <a href="#Page_409">Wardens’ Accounts</a> of
this date).</p>

<p>1666. Our Minute Books for this period having been lost
or stolen, we unfortunately have no records of the Great Fire beyond
those preserved in the “Wardens’ Accounts” (which see), and
although these are somewhat meagre, they are highly interesting,
especially those which relate to the fortunate preservation of the
great Holbein picture. It has been stated (but without any other
authority than that of gossiping Samuel Pepys, who had a special
interest in disparaging the picture) that it was damaged in the fire,
though no notice of such a mishap is known to me, and the Accounts<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
(which are <i>complete</i>) are significantly silent as to anything having
been spent on its restoration or cleansing, which, had it been injured,
would have been necessary; it seems to have been taken away
from the Hall by Major Brookes to a place of safety, and subsequently
brought home again by six porters.</p>

<div><p class="ti0em tac fs85">OLD ENTRANCE TO BARBER-SURGEONS’ HALL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Theatre, which was a detached building, as also the
present Court Room, both the works of Inigo Jones, were saved,
though the Hall was burned,
entailing a great expense upon
the Company in rebuilding (see
<a href="#Page_415">Wardens’ Accounts</a>).</p>

<p>The houses 33, 34 and 35,
Monkwell Street (see plan, <a href="#Page_134">p.&nbsp;135</a>)
were rebuilt 1671, when the gateway
to the Hall Court Yard was
formed and the grotesque coat-of-arms
put up over the Lintol.</p>

<p>When the alterations were
made under the superintendence
of Charles J. Shoppee in 1869,
the old lintol, corbels, tympanum,
and door-head were very carefully
taken down and refixed over the
present entrance to the Hall in the Court Yard. This door-head

<p>25th August, 1681. A short set of By-Laws was this day
enacted. It is on a single skin of parchment, and imposes penalties<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
upon such persons, as, being elected, should refuse to serve as
Masters or Stewards of Anatomy. It is signed by Heneage, Earl of
Nottingham, Lord Chancellor, and Sir Francis Pemberton and
Sir Francis North, the two Lords Chief Justices, all of whose seals
are pendant to the document.</p>

<p>1684. This was indeed a troublous year for the Corporation
and for the guilds of London. Charles having interfered with the
privileges of the City by thrusting in his nominees for Sheriffs, had
met with considerable opposition from the citizens, and being assured
that this resistance would be continued and maintained by the City,
he determined to strike a blow at the root of its franchise, by getting
into his hands the Charter of the City, as also the Charters of the
several Companies. It was not difficult to procure a venal tribunal
which would be prepared to pronounce an iniquitous judgment upon
any fictitious statement submitted to it by the King. Sir Rob<sup>t.</sup>
Sawyer, the Attorney-General, thereupon undertook, on behalf of
the Crown, to prove that the City Charters were forfeited, and
contrived the celebrated <i>quo warranto</i>, upon which judgment was (as a
matter of course) obtained against the City, on the 12th June, 1684.</p>

<p>The Companies seem to have unanimously anticipated this
decision, and by so doing and by “surrendering” their Charters
and liberties before the delivery of the judgment, hoped to ensure
the favour of the King.</p>

<p>The original of the “surrender” of the Barber-Surgeons is
very neatly engrossed on extra thick parchment, but the seal was
of course removed when it was returned to the Company. The
text is as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Similar forms of surrender were adopted by other Companies.
I am unable to say whether or no the King interfered with the
franchises of the Barber-Surgeons, but think not, as no record of
such meddling is to be found in our books, though, doubtless, the
Court took care, remembering the rod in pickle, to govern in accordance
with the wishes of the King.</p>

<p>Some time in this year (1684) certain unquiet spirits, Surgeons
of our Company, got up a petition to the King, setting forth that the
union of Surgeons with Barbers hindered rather than promoted the end
for which the two bodies had been united, and praying the King to
incorporate the Surgeons a distinct and separate body. Nothing came
of this application beyond a reference (ordered by the King, 15th May,
1684) to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and the Lord Chief<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
Justice of the King’s Bench, who were directed to examine and report
upon the petition, but whether they ever did so or not, I don’t know.</p>

<p>27th February, 1685. James II, in the first year of his reign,
granted us a Charter, which is contained on seven skins of parchment,
all of which have handsomely designed head-pieces and borders,
the first one having a fine portrait of the King as well; only a fragment
of the great seal remains, and the charter itself is considerably
damaged, apparently by rats. It is in Latin, of great length, and,
like others granted to other companies at the period, is an “unreal
mockery.” The Charter recites the “Surrender,” and proceeds to
grant another charter in which, <i>inter alia</i>, the appointment of any
Master, Warden, Assistant, or Clerk should be subject to the approval
of the King, that all members of the Company should take the Oaths
of Supremacy and Allegiance, be in the Communion of the Church
of England and receive the Sacrament, and that no person who
frequented a conventicle should be eligible for the Livery.</p>

<p>4th April, 1687. The King having published a declaration,
allowing liberty of conscience to all his subjects, suspending and
dispensing with the penal laws and tests, and even with the Oaths
of Supremacy and Allegiance on admission into offices civil and
military, numerous addresses of thanks for this liberty were presented
to the King, among others the following one from our Company,
which is preserved in the “London Gazette” of 20th October, 1687.</p>

<div class="blockhead">
<span class="smcap">The Humble Address of the Masters Governors Assistants
and Members of the Mystery and Commonalty of Barbers
and Surgeons of London.</span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We having daily before our eyes the munificent Bounties of your Royal Brother

<p><span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span></p>

<p>But we are in more especial manner bound to cast ourselves at Your Majesties

</div>

<p>1688. Matters were now rapidly approaching a crisis with
James, who in vain, when too late, sought to conciliate the citizens
whom he had wronged. One of his acts of propitiation was the
redelivery to the Companies of the “surrenders” which they had
made of their franchises and charters in 1684. We have no note of
the date of the return of our surrender; but it was towards the end of
November and within about a fortnight of the King’s flight when this
tardy act of justice was done, and the Barber-Surgeons thus partly
restored to their ancient rights and privileges. The Bill of Rights
was shortly afterwards passed, the <i>quo warranto</i> declared illegal, and
all charters granted by Charles II and James II since the judgment on
the <i>quo warranto</i>, declared absolutely null and void, thus practically
reinstating the Guilds in <i>statu quo ante</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>28 July, 1690. Ordered that in pursuance of an order of the Com̃on Counsell
&amp; Lord Mayor &amp;c. that the Company advance towards the provideing one Rigiment of
Horse &amp; one of Dragoone the sum̃e of one hundred pounds.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span></p>

<p>1699. Jealousies arose in the Company in consequence of the
more frequent election of Surgeons than Barbers, as Governors. The
By-Laws required that every year there should be two Barbers and
two Surgeons chosen (a Barber being defined to be any member who
did not practise Surgery). The Surgeons disregarding the law and
the old custom, seem to have been able to procure the election of an
undue number of members of their own craft to the offices of Master
and Wardens, whereupon certain of the Company filed an information
in the King’s Bench against the Masters or Governors; the Barbers
were successful, and having obtained a Mandamus, a fresh election took
place. This altercation between the Barbers and Surgeons was never
forgotten, and, indeed, helped to pave the way to further estrangement
and the absolute separation in 1745.</p>

<p>The following Minutes relate to these proceedings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>14th December, 1699. Ordered Mr. S<sup>r</sup>geant Wright Mr. S<sup>r</sup>geant Darnell Mr.
Com̃on S<sup>r</sup>geant &amp; Mr. Dee bee advised with upon the Informac͠on ag<sup>t</sup> the Govern<sup>rs.</sup></p>

<p>25th January, 1700. Ordered that the Cause ag<sup>t</sup> the Govern<sup>rs</sup> at the prosecuc͠on
of the Barbers bee referred to S<sup>r</sup>geant Darnell &amp; his opinion to bee taken &amp; to pˀceed
thereupon, Mr. Oades Mr. Pleahill &amp; Mr. Barnard to meet tomorrow at the raine bow to
attend him by five in the afternoone.</p>

<p>2nd May, 1700. Ordered Mr. Dee bee consulted concerning the Rule of
Court of King’s Bench for a copy of the by laws &amp;c. &amp; to follow his advice &amp;c. He
advised to give Copyes if required &amp; not to oppose it.</p>

<p>11th May, 1700. Ordered that Mr. S<sup>r</sup>geant Darnell have three guineys Mr.
Com̃on S<sup>r</sup>geant &amp; Mr. Dee have two a peece given them for the Tryall of the Informac͠on
on Tuesday next &amp; that all the Court of Assistants bee desired to bee there.</p>

<p>28th June, 1700. Ordered that nothing bee done in the Cause ag<sup>t</sup> the Company
untill the Mandamus be served &amp; then the Comittee to meete.</p>

<p>4th July, 1700. A pˀemtory Mandamus being served the last Court, Ordered
that on Tuesday next by two of the Clock in the afternoon there bee an elecc͠on of two
Wardens Expert in Barbery for the remainder of this yeare.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span></p>

<p>9th July, 1700. An election took place, with the result that
Mr. John Pinke and Mr. Richard Marks, both being Barbers, were
elected Wardens. Mr. Pinke was already a Warden, but the Mandamus
required two Barbers to be elected, and he was simply re-elected.
Mr. Marks took the place of Mr. Bartholomew King, Surgeon. The
Master, Mr. Lichfield, and the second Warden, Mr. James Wall, were
both Surgeons.</p>

<p>13th January, 1709. It was agreed that a new set of By-Laws
which had been settled by the Common Serjeant and Sir Edward
Northey should be presented to the Lord Chancellor, etc., for
confirmation, it being considered that the existing By-Laws were
defective in many parts, and that “good &amp; wholesome Lawes were
the life strength &amp; support of this Company.”</p>

<p>6th April, 1709. A set of By-Laws of this date was confirmed.
They are comprised on thirteen great skins of parchment, and, like
previous ones, are far too voluminous, and indeed not of sufficient
interest, to warrant transcribing, being practically the former set with
sundry technical and minor alterations. There is a fine portrait of
Queen Anne on the first skin, and the Document is signed by William
Lord Cowper, Lord Chancellor, Sir John Holt and Sir John Trevor,
Lords Chief Justices, whose seals are pendant. These By-Laws were
brought into Court on 5th May, 1709.</p>

<p>13th January, 1709. The Court were informed that the Barbers
of the Company were in treaty with the Peruke Makers “of the other
end of the town,” about incorporating them into this Company, and
that they were endeavouring to procure an Act of Parliament to that
effect, whereupon the proposition was approved and leave given to the
Barbers to petition Parliament in the name of the Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span></p>

<p>5th December, 1709. A petition was presented by sundry
liverymen (Barbers) representing that Peruke making was an encroachment
upon the art of Barbery, and praying the Court to obtain an
Act of Parliament incorporating the Peruke Makers with the Barber-Surgeons;
the petition was favourably received by the Court and a
Committee appointed, who met the next day and recommended the
proposed union, the Peruke Makers paying such fees as other
members of the Company paid.</p>

<p>24th December, 1709. A petition for an Act was ordered
to be drawn by the Clerk and submitted to several eminent counsel
for their perusal.</p>

<p>9th January, 1710. Five hundred copies of the proposed Bill,
and a similar number of the reasons for the suggested incorporation,
were ordered to be printed; but in the result nothing came of this
proposed union with the Peruke Makers.</p>

<p>25th August, 1714. The following precept relating to the
Accession of George I was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="sidenote">
<span class="smcap">To the Master and Wardens of<br />

<p>23rd December, 1717. The Company having had great
difficulty in getting in some of their rents, and various of the houses
being empty, determined to sell their property in Mowse Alley,
East Smithfield, and in Butcher Row in St. Botolph’s, Aldgate,
agreeing to convey the fee simple to Mr. Robert Finlay for £1,250.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And it is further ordered by this Court that till such time as the said sume
of 1250<sup>li</sup> can be laid out in a convenient purchase of houses or lands with the
approbac͠on of the Court of Assistants, The same shall be forthwith placed out at
Interest by the Governors upon such Government or other Publick securitys as they shall
think fitt, But that the said sume of 1250<sup>li</sup> or any part thereof shall never be expended
on the Company’s common occac͠ons or be any way lessened or broke into on any
account whatsoever.</p></div>

<p>17th April, 1718. The following record was ordered to be
made of the “reasons” for disposing of this property:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Estate in East Smithfield in eleven years time produced to the Company
above all disbursements relating <span class="nowrap">thereto<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> but £28 15<i>s.</i> in the whole, Whereas the
annual interest of £1250 at 4 pˀ cent. is £50.</p>

<p>Eleven years interest at £50 pˀ ann. for £1250 amounts to without computeing
Interest upon Interest £550.</p>

<p>The Company have run behind hand for severall years by means of the great
sumes laid out upon this Estate.</p>

<p>Whoever goes backward every year must in time be undone.</p>

<p>The Estate is still in such a condition as to require a great sum̃e of money to be
expended upon it in Repairing and Rebuilding in order to make it tenantable.</p>

<p>The Company had not money to lay out upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span></p>

<p>If they had, the Estate is so scituated that there is no room to hope, even
in case the whole had been rebuilt (as it wants to be) that it would have answered
the laying out so much money.</p>

<p>And if the Company had let it upon building Leases The pˀsent method
of building is so as to last exactly the term for which the Lease is taken, wouˀd have put
the Company in the same condic͠on as they are now, when the term expired, besides loss
of Rent, &amp; disputes with such Tenants in the mean time.</p>

<p>It was therefore thought better to dispose of the Estate.</p></div>

<p>Following are the details of negotiations with one or two
parties other than Mr. Finlay, and some curious particulars of the
Company’s title to part of the Estate, which seems to have been
an equitable rather than a legal one, whereby the Court apprehended
some difficulty in disposing of it to another party from whom a
somewhat better price might have been obtained, and therein, under
the circumstances, showed themselves good men of business by
concluding with Mr. Finlay: we cannot however now, but regret
that this most valuable property should have passed from us for so
comparatively insignificant a sum. The purchase-money was laid out
in thirteen East India Bonds of £100 each.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7th April, 1730. M<sup>r</sup> Serj<sup>t</sup> Dickins the Master of the Company informing
the Court, That he having the honour to be acquainted with the Right Honourable
The Earl of Burlington and with his Lordships most extraordinary genius and superior
judgment in Architecture, had taken the liberty to address himself to the said noble
Earl, and to make it his humble request to his Lordship that he would be pleased
to favour the Company with his opinion, in what manner it would be safest and best
to repair the anatomical Theatre built by the celebrated Inigo Jones about one
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>That his Lordship had thereupon condescended to take a view of the Theatre
and most obligingly directed the proper method of repairing a structure of so peculiar a
frame, and afterwards out of his accustomed generosity, and in regard to the memory
of that great Architect offered to defray the expence thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It is thereupon resolved Nemine Contradicente</span> by this Court,
That the Master and Wardens of the Company together with the late Master
William Cotesworth Esq<sup>r</sup> be, and they are hereby desired forthwith to wait on the
Right Honb̃le The Earl of Burlington, and in the most gratefull manner to assure
his Lordship in the name of the whole Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> they do receive this noble instance of his Lordships bounty and
generosity as a most distinguishing &amp; illustrious mark of honour shown by his Lordship
to the Company &amp; Profession.</p>

<p>And that this Court will take care so to record &amp; transmitt the remembrance of
this magnificent action of his Lordship to their successors That the gratitude of the
Company to his Lordship’s person and memory may be for ever preserved among them.</p></div>

<p>13th August, 1730. A marble Bust of the Earl of Burlington
was ordered to be set up in the Theatre.</p>

<p>27th April, 1739. “The Court taking into their considerac͠on
that several of their By-Laws, which had been confirmed by the
Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justices for the time being, were
in want of alteration, by reason of the variation of the times and
circumstances of the Company and their Members since such By-Laws
were made, and several new By-Laws being also wanting for the
better government of the Company in times to come,” It was ordered
that a Committee of six should consult and draw up fresh By-Laws,
to be submitted to a future Court of Assistants, but in the result no
action was taken.</p>

<p>1744. The long slumbering animosity between the Surgeons
and the Barbers had now reached a climax, and indeed it is a matter
of surprise that an union which had become grotesque should have
existed for as many years as it had. The Surgeons, many of whom
had attained to great eminence, naturally chafed under a system
which required their diplomas to be signed by Governors, two
of whom were always Barbers, or members of some trade or<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
profession other than that of a Surgeon, and with the rapid progress
of science and of surgical skill and knowledge, they felt their
alliance with the Barbers a restraint upon their advancement, as also
that the exercise of their profession under Charters and By-Laws,
antiquated in form, and more adapted to the times in which they were
framed, a hindrance rather than an incitement to further proficiency.</p>

<p>There is little in the records as to this disagreement, it being
tacitly agreed that neither side should place their arguments or
grievances in the books, which were their joint property.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>20th December, 1744. This day the gentlemen on the Surgeons side having
made known at this Court their desire of being separated from the gentlemen on the
Barbers and that each may be made a distinct and independent Body free from each
other, and producing a Case intended to be offered to the Honourable House of
Commons praying such separation, which being read at this Court It was agreed that
the following gentlemen on the Barbers side viz<sup>t.</sup>&mdash;</p>

<p class="mt-05em">M<sup>r.</sup> Warden Negus M<sup>r.</sup> Parker M<sup>r.</sup> Maurice M<sup>r.</sup> Truelove and M<sup>r.</sup> Haddon.</p>

<p class="ti0em">&amp; on the Surgeons side viz<sup>t.</sup>&mdash;</p>

<p class="mt-05em">M<sup>r.</sup> Serj<sup>t</sup> Dickins Will<sup>m</sup> Petty Esq<sup>r</sup> James Dansie Esq<sup>re</sup> M<sup>r.</sup> Freke and M<sup>r.</sup> Sainthill</p>

<p class="ti0em mt-05em">be a Committe appointed to meet on Monday next at the Kings Arms Tavern
in Saint Paul’s Church Yard at one of the Clock at noon to receive the proposals from
the Gentlemen on the Surgeon’s side for such Separation, and that when they had so
done that the Gentlemen on the Barber’s side members of this Court should lay the
same before the Livery on their side, by a Meeting to be had for that purpose, and that
a Court of Assistants should be held on the Tenth day of January next, at which time
the Gentlemen on the Barber’s Side Members of this Court, should then report their
opinion and assent or Dissent to such proposals made.</p>

<p>At the same time it was agreed that any Member of this Court should at any
time have the free liberty of examining and inspecting into the several Books and
writings belonging to this Company In case the same should be in the presence of
the Master or one of the Wardens but not otherwise, but no such Books or writings
be at any time removed from the Hall, on any account whatever unless by a special
order of this Court first had and obtained for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span></p>

<p>10th January, 1745. Pursuant to an Order of the last Court of Assistants
the gentlemen on the Barbers side Members of this Court, did this day make their
report on the proposals made by the gentlemen on the Surgeons side for a separation,
by Dissenting in general to such proposals made.</p></div>

<p>By the Journals of the House of Commons, 18 George II, it
appears that the Surgeons on 31st January, 1745, presented a petition
to Parliament, in which among other things they recited the Act,
32 Henry VIII, and also that Charles I in the 5th year of his reign,</p>

<div class="blockquot mt-1em">
by Letters Patent under the great seal confirmed the Barber Surgeon’s Company
in their possessions and privileges and gave the Company power to make by-laws
and to constitute ten persons to be Examiners of Surgeons during their lives, and it was
thereby further granted that no person whether freeman foreigner native of England
or alien should practise Surgery in London or Westminster or within seven miles of
the City of London unless previously examined allowed and admitted by the Company
in manner therein mentioned; and that the Surgeons so examined might practise in
any part of England; and that the Masters and Governors of the said Company might
appoint and have a public lecture for the science of Surgery, for the better instruction
and information in the principles and rudiments of the art and science of Surgery,
and that no person exercising the art of Surgery within the limits therein mentioned
should go out or send any apprentice or servant from the Port of London to serve
in quality of a Surgeon for any ship without the approbation and allowance of the
said Company, in such manner and under such penalties as are therein mentioned.
That since the said Act for incorporating the two said Companies, those of the said
Company practising Surgery have from their sole and constant study of, and application
to the said science, rendered the profession and practice thereof of great and public
benefit and utility to this Kingdom, and that the Barbers belonging to the said
Corporation are now, and have been many years, employed in a business foreign to
and independent of the practice of Surgery; and that the Surgeons belonging to the
same Corporation, being now become a numerous and considerable body, and finding
their union with the Barbers inconvenient in many respects and in no degree conducive
to the progress or improvement of the art of Surgery, are therefore desirous that the
Surgeons being freemen of the said Company, may be made a Corporation separate
and distinct from and independent of the Barbers of, and belonging to the said Company;
and therefore praying the House to give leave that a bill may be brought in dissolving
and vacating the union and incorporation of the Barbers and Surgeons made by<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
the said former act; and for making the Surgeons of the said Company a separate
and distinct Corporation; and for making a partition and division of the real and
personal estate and effects of and belonging to the said united Company, unto and for
the separate benefit of the said two Companies so proposed to be separated, as to this
House shall seem meet and reasonable.</div>

<p>Whereupon it was <span class="nowrap">ordered&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the said petition be referred to the consideration of a Committee and
that they do examine the matter thereof, and report the same with their opinion
thereupon to the House.</p></div>

<p>A Committee was at once appointed with power to send for
persons, papers, and records.</p>

<p>On the 6th February the Barbers presented a Petition against
the proposed separation, and asked to be heard by counsel; whereupon
it was <span class="nowrap">ordered&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the said petition be referred to the consideration of the Committee to
whom the petition of the Surgeons of London, whose names are thereunto subscribed, on
behalf of themselves and other the Surgeons in the City and suburbs of London is
referred: And that these petitioners the said Barbers, if they think fit be heard by their
Counsel before the said Committee according to the prayer of the said petitioners.</p></div>

<p>This petition of the Barbers to the House of Commons was
identical with a very scarce pamphlet “The Case of the Barbers,” a
copy of which has been kindly given to me by Mr. D’Arcy Power, M.A.
It is full of interest, and will be found in <a href="#APPENDIX_E">Appendix E</a>.</p>

<p>27th February, 1745. The Committee brought up their report,
which was read by the Clerk, and recited the various documents
produced and the evidence tendered; among other matters it is stated
that Mr. John Hayward, a Past Master, was examined and deposed,
that the Master (who every other year was a Barber) and the Wardens
present, sign the diplomas. That there are ten Examiners who have<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
each half a guinea for their attendance, and the Master and Wardens
have the like. That he did not know that the presence of Barbers at
these examinations was any inconvenience, but he apprehended it
would be more eligible if the Master were always a Surgeon. That
the Barbers are generally present at the four public lectures of
Anatomy, two of which are at the expense of the Company, the other
two being at the expense of the Surgeons. That the Demonstrators
of Anatomy and Osteology are chosen by the whole Court of Assistants
(fifteen of whom are Barbers, and fifteen Surgeons). That he
apprehends the present union is the reason why so many persons
do not bind their sons apprentice at the Hall. He never knew of the
Barbers interfering in or giving interruption to examinations, and he
never heard any fact mentioned as a reason for the separation desired
by the Surgeons, except that a great many foreign brothers (who are
gentlemen that practise both in and out of town) refuse to come into
the Company on account of the present expense.</p>

<p>Being examined as to the money generally given to the Poor’s
Box by Sea Surgeons at the time of their receiving a Qualification,
he said that it was always expected, but that if they are not in a
capacity it is not insisted upon, and that he never heard of any
person being denied a Qualification for refusing to pay it. That
the Qualification is delivered to the party sealed up, to be carried
to the Navy Office, and that the Master commonly signifies to him
what fees are expected; that the said Box is examined every month,
and about nine-tenths of the money distributed by the Master and
Wardens, among the poor of the Barbers.</p>

<p>Being asked what proportion the Barbers pay to the Poor’s Box,
he said that the greatest part of the income applied to that use arises
from the examination of Sea Surgeons, but that the Apprentices of<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
Barbers (who are as twenty to one) always pay when bound at the
Hall, and at their admission to the freedom, as well as the Surgeons.</p>

<p>Mr. Hayward put before the Committee a statement of the
fines received by the Company, which was as <span class="nowrap">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Clerk’s and Beadle’s fees are not included in the above.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Wheeler, the Clerk of the Company, was examined
by the Committee, and generally confirmed Mr. Hayward’s evidence.</p>

<p>The next witness, Mr. Neil Stewart, was evidently called in
the interest of the Surgeons, to show the inconvenience which had
arisen (in his case at all events) by reason of the warrants being issued
by the “<i>Barbers</i> and Surgeons.” He deposed that he was surgeon<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
to H.M.S. The Looe, and, being taken prisoner by the French, was
put in the common prison at Brest, where he petitioned to be removed
to an open hospital at Dinan, and enclosed his warrant as a surgeon
with his petition to the French authorities; some days after, he
enquired of the “Linguist” as to the success of his petition, and
was informed that “the Superintendent did not know by his warrant
whether he (the witness) was a Barber <i>or</i> a Surgeon: that upon his
desiring the linguist to read the warrant, by which it would appear
he was a surgeon, the linguist replied that it might be so, but that if
the witness had been taken on board one of the King of Great
Britain’s ships it would have been out of doubt.” This witness further
stated that he believed the unfavourable notice which was taken of
his petition was because his warrant came from the Masters of the
<i>Barbers</i> and Surgeons.</p>

<p>With reference to the gift of Edward Arris the Court minutes of
29th February, 1675–6 were produced which stated that “Mr. Edward
Arris a very worthy member of this Company having formerly
settled by Deed £30 a year for a dissection of a body yearly and
Reading on the Muscles, desired that deed might be delivered up to
him,” and he in return would pay the Company £510 to enable them
to apply the interest to the same purposes, which was agreed to.
Mr. Arris dying on the 28th May, 1676, the Company soon became
involved in a Chancery suit with his son, Dr. Thomas Arris, and the
Court minutes of 20th January, 1677–8 were produced and read
to the Committee. These set forth the answer which the Company
filed to the Bill of Complaint before the Master of the Rolls, and
stated the circumstances referred to in the minutes of 29th February,
1675–6, and that Mr. Arris gave as his reason for this “That his
only son and heir, the now Doctor, had and did then receive the
profits of the said lands to his own use upon condition and under
<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>promise to pay the said £30 per annum for the said Dissection; but
he found that he did never pay one penny of it, or ever would do,
when he their benefactor was dead, without trouble or suit; with
some severe and sharp expressions, which we will by no means
mention, although they were the very words of the father spoken
of the son.”</p>

<p>The answer goes on to express the hope that the Company will
not be compelled to enter into any further covenant with Dr. Arris
than they had done with his father their “pious benefactor,” for the
carrying out of the trust, or be ordered to refund the £510 to
Dr. Arris. It also prayed that he might be ordered to pay the
costs of “this troublesome and unnecessary suit, which doth so
much shew what they must expect from him hereafter, if they should
part with the £510.” As the Company retained the £510 till the
separation in 1745, there is no doubt but that Dr. Arris, as he
deserved to do, lost his suit.</p>

<p>Various extracts from the Company’s books were read, on
behalf of the Barbers, to show that the united Company had always
assisted the Surgeons, and promoted the cause and interest of Surgery
out of the common fund of the Barbers and Surgeons.</p>

<p>Part of the Will of Robert Ferbras, Citizen and Surgeon,
dated 2nd December, 1470<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> was read, whereby it appeared that
several estates formerly belonging to the said Company, were given
to the Barbers before their union with the Surgeons in Henry VIII’s
time. And a declaration of Bryan Sandford, dated 8th March, 1490,
was read, whereby it appeared that the site of the Hall was purchased
by the Barbers before the said Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span></p>

<p>The Committee of the House of Commons reported that
they had recommended the parties to settle the dispute as to the
division of the property between them, and that thereupon the
Surgeons had proposed that they should have given up to them
Dr. Gale’s Annuity of £16 per annum and Alderman Arris’ gift of
£510; also that for about three years until the Surgeons could
provide themselves with suitable premises, they should have the
use of the Hall, Theatre, &amp;c., at a nominal rent of one guinea
per annum.</p>

<p>The Barbers agreed to give up Gale’s and Arris’ gifts, but
proposed that the Surgeons should take a lease for such days in
the year as they commonly used the premises, at £80 per annum,
and pay the Barbers £100 towards the expenses to which they had
been put by this suit in the Parliament.</p>

<p>In the result the Committee reported:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) That the Surgeons
had made good the allegations of their petition. (<i>b</i>) That the proposed
separation was desirable. (<i>c</i>) That the propositions of the Surgeons
touching the division of the property were reasonable.</p>

<p>Subsequently the Bill passed both Houses and received the
Royal Assent, the quaint union being dissolved 25th June, 1745.</p>

<p>By this Act (18 Geo. II) the Surgeons were erected into a
separate Corporation, and the Barbers were re-incorporated under
the style of “The Master, Governors and Commonalty of the
Mystery of Barbers of London.” So much of this Act as relates
to the Barbers will be found in the <a href="#APPENDIX_F">Appendix F</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span></p>

<p>The first Court of Assistants of “<span class="antiqua">The Barbers’ Company</span>”
was held on the 25th June, 1745, at 10&nbsp;a.m., and there were <span class="nowrap">present:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Act of Separation being read, and the Oaths as formerly
required to be taken by Freemen, Master, Warden, Assistant,
Clerk, and Beadle being also read and considered, the Court
settled and formulated the various Oaths, and the same are entered
in the Minutes.</p>

<p>The Election of nine fit and able persons to be Assistants was
then proceeded with, and Mr. William Jackson, Mr. John Bearblock,
Mr. Will<sup>m.</sup> Roberts, Mr. Thomas Cotton, Mr. John Whiting, Mr.
Richard Lookes, James Theobald, Esqre., Peter Theobald, Esqre., and
Mr. John Pepys, were unanimously elected.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Boxley and Mr. Samuel Rutter were chosen third
and fourth Governors or Wardens.</p>

<p>Thanks were voted to Mr. Jonathan Medley and Mr. Humphry
Negus “for their great care in defending and preserving the Rights
Priviledges and property of this Company on their Separation from
the Surgeons.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span></p>
<p>Thanks were also voted to Mr. John Paterson “for his great
care and diligence in executing the orders and directions of the Master
and Governor about the defence and preservation of the rights
priviledges and property of the Company” and to further mark their
sense of the same, the Court unanimously elected Mr. Paterson
as Clerk.</p>

<p>The two Beadles, Henry Gretton and William Littlebury
were re-elected.</p>

<p>It was ordered that all Charters, Books, Plate and goods
belonging to the Company, then in the custody of Mr. Joseph
Wheeler (the late Clerk) should be delivered to Mr. Paterson, who
was to make and sign an Inventory of the same, and also to examine
Mr. Wheeler’s accounts, and report thereon to the Court.</p>

<p>The Common Seal was directed to be altered by omitting the
words <span class="smcap">Et Chirurgorum</span> and by adding <span class="smcap">Anno</span> MDCCXLV.</p>

<p>A Committee was appointed to peruse the By-Laws of the late
United Company, and to report as to which of them required amendment
or were fit to be repealed or added to.</p>

<p>8th August, 1751. Mr. John Brooks attended and produced
a Deed to which he requested the subscription of the Court; this deed
recited that by an Act of Parliament passed in the 10th year of
Queen Anne, it was enacted that a duty of 2<i>d.</i> per lb. should be laid
upon all starch imported, and of 1<i>d.</i> per lb. upon all starch made
in Great Britain, that no perfumer, barber, or seller of hair-powder
should mix any powder of alabaster, plaster of Paris, whiting, lime,
etc. (sweet scents excepted), with any starch to be made use of for
making hair-powder, under pain of forfeiting the hair-powder and £50,<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
and that any person who should expose the same for sale should
forfeit it and £20. Also that by further Acts additional duties were
laid upon starch. And by an Act passed in the 4th year of George II
the penalties were somewhat mitigated. “And whereas the said laws
with respect to hair-powder have by experience been found not to
answer the end proposed by the Legislature, the sum arising by the
said duties upon starch and hair-powder having gradually lessened,
whilst the fair traders have been great sufferers by the practice of
those who by the greatness of the duty have attempted to make vend
or use the said prohibited articles. And whereas the trade or business
of making vending or dressing of Perukes or other Ornaments
of hair for the head and also of cutting and dressing the hair of the
head being considered as distinct from the business of Barbers is under
no regulation whatever,” etc., the parties whom Mr. Brooks represented
(and whose names were signed to the deed) had, therefore,
agreed to join in an application to Parliament for reducing the duties
on hair-powder, as also for incorporating all persons carrying on the
trade of Barbers and Peruke-makers within the Bills of Mortality,
into one joint Corporation or Body politick, and for restraining
persons from exercising those trades who had not served seven years’
apprenticeship.</p>

<p>It was stated that subscriptions towards defraying the costs
of the proposed Bill had been paid to Messrs. Gosling &amp; Bennett,
Bankers in Fleet Street, that John Paterson, Esq., Clerk of the
Company, was Solicitor for the Bill, and Mr. John Brooks was
Secretary of the Petitioners.</p>

<p>The Court, having considered the application, decided to
contribute Twenty Guineas, but the matter seems to have been
in abeyance for eighteen months, as the petition to the House<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
of Commons was not sealed by the Company until the 7th
January, 1753.</p>

<p>13th January, 1753. The petition was this day presented and
is recorded in the Journals of the House; it states, among other
things, that the Company “are in danger of being unable to support
themselves and that the petitioners who exercise the art of Peruke
making in the liberties and neighbourhood of the said City are not
a body corporate, nor under any order or regulation; for want whereof
great frauds are practised in the said manufacture to the discouragement
of the fair trader, and manifest injury of the consumer, And
therefore praying the House that leave may be given for the bringing
in a Bill for incorporating the Peruke makers as well within as
without the liberties of the City of London, and within such distance
thereof as the House shall think fit, with the said petitioners”&mdash;the
Barbers’ Company. This petition was referred to a Committee, but no
report of that Committee is entered in the Journals.</p>

<p>4th December, 1764. The Peruke makers turned up again
in 1764, for we find in the Minutes that certain of them attended with
the draft of a petition to the King, to which they asked the assent
of the Court. This petition which strangely commenced “We the
Company of Barbers <i>and Peruke makers</i>,” stated that the suppliants
laid before his Majesty the distresses into which the Peruke makers
had fallen by reason of the change of fashion, and thus appeals to the
King, “Where can we look for relief but there only where it is
to be found, for as the Fashion your Majesty approves will very justly
be a pattern to your subjects, We most humbly hope not to be too bold
in wishing Perukes may soon be as much in fashion as the wearing of
hair is at present, which will increase the Revenue, give happiness to
the indigent and distressed Peruke makers, and increase the many<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
great unmerited Favours, We as a Company have received from
Royal Hands!”</p>

<p>16th January, 1765. The Court took this ridiculous petition
into consideration, and of course refused to adopt it, informing the
suppliants that they were concerned to observe the decay in their trade,
as it was connected by usage with that of Barbery, but as the Charters
of the Company did not extend to Peruke making, the Court could not
with propriety address his Majesty on the subject.</p>

journeyman and set him to work, before presenting him to the Master
and Wardens, under a penalty of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per week.</p>

<p>This order was made because many foreigners (<i>i.e.</i>, non-freemen)
who were inexpert had lately come into the City, and the Court
directed that each foreigner should give proof of his skill, and then
that he should remain for one year only and in one service, and no
Barber was to pay a foreigner higher wages than the Masters should
from time to time “sess” or determine under a penalty of 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for “every weke so offending.” The Beadle was directed to keep
a register book of all foreigners for the year, and when the year
was expired, the Barber who kept a foreigner and was minded to
keep him longer was to come to the Hall within fourteen days to
have him re-registered under a penalty of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per week. And no
Barber was to “entyce or envegyll any mans servant from him upon
peyne of forfeyting for a fyne xiij<sup>s.</sup> iiij<sup>d.</sup>”</p>

<p>4th July, 1566. It was ordained that if any of the Court
hereafter might “happen to lyght or fall into povertie or dekaye” that
he should have a pension out of the Common box. One who had served
as Master was to have per ann. £4; an Upper Governor £3; Second

<p>The Beadle was directed to look after, and to help in removing

had been used on any public occasion, and a small yearly fee was
to be allowed him for this service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span></p>

<p>3rd November, 1566. Edward Parke, referred to in the

<p>16th Jan., 1567. The old vellum book of ordinances, etc.,
containing portions of the four Gospels in Latin, and still in our
possession is probably the book referred to in the minute of this date,
which states that Willm̄ Grene had “taken an othe upon the blacke
booke that serveth in this howse for the same purpose.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>13th Nov., 1567. Yt ys ordayned that Wyllyam Bull Chrystofor Swalldell

<p>Again this year a licence for a similar purpose was granted to
Francis Partridge, and there are other instances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>18th May, 1568. In this Courte here was Phillip Jorden for trymynge on the

<p>13th Oct., 1568. Here was W<sup>m</sup> fferrat for Trymyng upon the Sonday but he wyll
do yt no more here after.</p></div>

<p>About this period there were numerous cases of Sunday trading
before the Court, and in many instances the offenders were fined or
imprisoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>9th Nov., 1568. In thys Courte here was Rich Roberts and he is comanded

dysmyst of his office and yong<sup>r</sup> govˀnorshyp and also fourth of assystents of the saide
mystery.</p></div>

<p>Wysto appears from time to time to have given the Court
trouble, his offence on this particular occasion being that he had
ordered his apprentice to let a man blood in the Compter contrary
to the order of the Aldermen. Wysto was contumacious for a long
period, but seems on 17th July, 1572, to have made humble submission
and apology, whereupon an order was made “That none do stirre
upp any talke consr̃ninge the deprivac͠on or submyssion of Ric.
Wistowe”; he was subsequently re-admitted on to the Court and
served Master 1586, but the animus against him revived, and on
7th November, 1587, certain parties were before the Court for reviling
him on the old score, and were duly threatened and admonished as
to their future behaviour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>22nd November, 1569. Here was Phillip Jordan for trymming upon the
sabboth daye and he once agayne is warned upon the penalltie of the acte that he

<p>1568 to 1570. There are several entries in the books of
members of the Court being removed for misbehaviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span></p>

<p>27th January, 1571. It was ordered <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Bayle was a movable stand or platform; there are various
notices as to the one previously in use, having been out of repair.
It was taken out on all great days of processions or triumphs and
on Christmas day when the “lorde maior went to Poules,” and
numerous references are also made to the Company’s banners which
accompanied it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>19th January, 1573. Here was Willm̄ Carrington for havinge iiij servaunts one

<p>26th May, 1573. Here was John Johnsonne and brought in his fyne for
kepinge a foryner uncest xx<sup>d.</sup></p></div>

<p>There are frequent entries of freemen being fined for not
“cessing” foreigners and journeymen, and for teaching foreigners
their “science.”</p>

<p>It would seem from the following precise minute that commitments
to prison were made by the Court direct, and not always upon
Warrants obtained from the Lord Mayor or a Justice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>15th March, 1575. Here was one Mˀkes [Markes] servñte w<sup>th</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Tholmwood

in wordes acts countenaunce or otherwise at their uttmost pˀyll, whereupon all the
whole Companye were sent for and had that Comaundement.</p></div>

<p>1577. Thomas Hall (see <a href="#Page_183">4th July, 1566</a>) was appointed an
Examiner in Surgery and to dissect the anatomies for ten years.</p>

<p>There are several instances of exhibitions to sons of freemen
(generally 40<i>s.</i> a year), to enable them to study at Oxford and
Cambridge, and these entries extend over a great many years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>22nd Oct., 1577. Here was M<sup>r</sup> Skarlet the Quenes Bargeman and he pˀmised
the Companie that they shoulde have a barge called the Greyhounde belonging to the
maydes of honor for lij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d</sup> yf my Lorde maior do go unto westmˀ.</p></div>

<p>This sum would not of course include the Bargemaster’s or his

attendants, all of which were paid for by the Company in addition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>23rd July, 1582. At this Coˀte John Yates Thomas Lamkin and Edward Parke

<p><span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span></p>

<p>21st Nov., 1583. Mr. Banester, a liveryman, being indebted to
the Company £5, gave a “watche or clock” and it was ordered that his
debt should be cancelled in consideration of this gift.</p>

<p>The following minute refers to the obit for John Johnson (<i>vide</i> 6th
March, 1583) the property having been declared to be held for
superstitious uses, the Company purchased their right to retain its
possession for £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The next is a curious instance of an ancient tenure.</p>

<p>29th Sept., 1586. A lease for 21 years of a house in East
Smithfield was granted to Humphry Rowland at £6 per annum, and
the said Humphry was <span class="nowrap">to&mdash;</span></p>

<p>9th February, 1596. It was agreed for “the taking in of the
water w<sup>ch</sup> cometh from the Themes by pipes into this howse.” Heretofore
the water had been supplied from a well, and later on by a
leaden “pomp.”</p>

<p>1596. In this year a curious episode occurred, which showed
that the Court were not unwilling to shield their freemen when<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
offending, if the party taking action against the offender did not
belong to the Company. Four freemen (one being an Assistant)
had been “put into” the Court of Exchequer by “one Holmes an
Informer for using both Barbery and Chirurgery against the Statute,”
and the Court, without troubling to enquire if the offence had been
committed or not, ordered that £10 should be lent the parties to
assist them in defending the suit. At the next Court the matter was
much debated as to whether the Barber-Surgeons should go on with
their defence or make terms with the informer, and the parties themselves
were consulted, whereupon it was finally decided “among
themselves to agree w<sup>th</sup> the said Informer w<sup>ch</sup> they related to the whole
Corte, whereupon the Corte rose and the said pˀties made their owne
agreement privately w<sup>th</sup> the saied Informer to their best likinge.”</p>

<p>10th December, 1596. Mr. Storer came to the Court and
agreed with the Company, by indenture, in consideration of £5 per

respect of the provision of grain for serving the market during
that period.</p>

Anatomy and “freelye gave one standinge cup double guilte w<sup>ch</sup> was

account of the Election of Master and Wardens; twelve Electors
from among the Livery were <span class="nowrap">appointed:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1598. In the Minute Book commencing 1598 there are scores
of cases of Barbers being fined for working on Sundays; the informant
was generally the Beadle, and it is amusing to note how frequently a
delinquent, after purging himself by a fine, voluntarily took to the office
of Informer against his brother Barbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span></p>

<p>Many Barbers and Surgeons were fined for presuming to
“sett up shoppe” without licence, here is an <span class="nowrap">instance:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>16th August, 1638. A stormy election of Master and Wardens

<p class="ti0em mt-08em">by reason that certain of the Electors being of divers trades
were unable to agree upon two persons expert in Barbery, and these
Electors refusing to choose two Masters Barbers, a Court was at once
held and the six Barber Electors were discharged, six more Electors
being chosen and called; two of these, however, being contaminated
by those already dismissed, refused to serve, and eventually a fresh
set of Electors was chosen, who retired, and elected Mr. William
Clowes, Serjeant-Surgeon to the King, as Master, and three others
Wardens, “and after dinner ended and the Seremonye pˀformed
by the Masters or Governo<sup>rs</sup> of chooseing the new M<sup>rs</sup> or Governo<sup>rs</sup>

Wardens were sworn in.</p>

Morrice in the Earl Marshal’s Court, when the sentence pronounced
against him was that he should attend the Court at the Hall, and there
bareheaded rehearse in an audible voice an abject apology, the exact
words of which are set out. This Morrice did, and the Master and
Wardens having testified the same, he was again called into Court,
when it would seem that his apology had been made under fear of the
Earl Marshal and not of his free will, for the Court calling upon him to
make answer “for his contentious carriage &amp; foule &amp; bitter languages
&amp; invective speeches by him given from Court to Court ag<sup>t</sup> divers
Assistantꝭ to the generall disturbance of their Courtꝭ he refused to

him from his place as an Assistant.</p>

to be dismissed from his office of an Examiner in Surgery, and out of
the Court of Assistants.</p>

<p>10th March, 1707. The new Clerk, Mr. Chas. Bernard, seems
to have been industrious in searching out practising Barbers not free of
the Company, as also others who had committed abuses; several were
fined and compelled to take up their freedom and this day the following
entries <span class="nowrap">occur:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

summoned appeared, and their cases were heard; a few examples will
suffice&mdash;One Darby was “seen to comb a persons haire on Sunday

with 5<i>s.</i> fine.</p>

<p>Lewis Roger made answer that it “was onely his Apprentice
combing a persons haire without his knowledge and that it was
his first offence,” he likewise escaped with a 5<i>s.</i> fine.</p>

<p>James Good was more fortunate, for proving that his offence
“was onely the Combing of a Lodgers Wigg,” he escaped.</p>

<p>Willm. Haslegrove appears to have filled up the measure of
his iniquity, for being detected in “actually shaveing a person on
Sunday morning,” he was fined 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Samuel Beaumont, charged with keeping two Barbers’ shops,
had a month given him to part with one of them, and John Shoard

<p>The number of Barbers fined for working on Sundays, or for
keeping shop not being free, was enormous, and it becomes wearying
to travel through the records of their offences and fines.</p>

the disbanding the Army which gives liberty to disbanded soldiers to exercise any
trade within the Corporations or places where they were borne, althoˀ they had not
served seven years to it But the Court believing that act did not extend to Drudge
by reason he was not borne in London, ordered that in case he did not shut up his
Shop in a month’s time he should be prosecuted.</p></div>

<p>21st July, 1709. In consequence of the great expense to which
the Company had been put in the repairs to the Hall, the Court
determined to call thirty-one freemen into the Livery, and the fine
being £10 each on admission or £20 on refusal, a considerable
sum was realized.</p>

<p>It having been suggested to the Court that the yeomanry
objected to pay 20<i>s.</i> for “corn money” when called to the Livery,
the Clerk was directed to enquire into the origin of that tax, and
finding that it had been originally levied on each member taking his
livery, to satisfy the precepts made in 1633, and afterwards for
providing a stock of corn for the City; and for that at the present
time the Company had no Granary or stock of corn to provide, and
“being out of debt,” it was ordered that in future this fine should be
discontinued.</p>

<p>18th August, 1709. At the Election, ten of the Livery who
had attended without their gowns, were severally fined and paid 1<i>s.</i><span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>

reasons and praying that the Court would petition the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and Common Council to suspend the act of Common
Council restraining them from employing foreigners as journeymen,
whereupon the matter was considered and the Court thought it
would be contrary to their oaths to join in any such petition,
because it was a standing By-Law of the Company, as well as
of the City, that no Barber should employ any foreigner as a
journeyman; it was also considered that such a liberty would prove
a great discouragement to apprentices and that the present inconvenience
complained of would soon be cured if Masters would
sufficiently instruct their apprentices so as to make them useful
during their servitude and competent as journeymen afterwards.
The Court further decided to oppose, by every means in its power,
the movement set on foot by Mr. Berney and his friends.</p>

and the Company not then having a barge. The Barber-Surgeons
let off part of their Barge-house to the Drapers and Ironmongers, and
the Clerk was instructed to give those Companies notice that it
was not the intention of this Company to renew the lease from

<p>4th February, 1755. William Shakespear (Barber) the apprentice
of Richard Hulett, was admitted to the freedom.</p>

<p>5th June, 1764. The Clerk informed the Court of the death of
Mrs. Elizabeth I’Ans, widow of Mr. Michael I’Ans, and that the
Master and Wardens had, on the 23rd May, received of the Executors
of Mr. I’Ans £2,200&mdash;<span class="nowrap">3 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> per cent. Bank Annuities, and £75 in
accordance with Mr. I’Ans’ will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span></p>

<p>1764 and 1765. Mr. James Clowes who had been summoned
to take up the Livery, refused to do so, whereupon he was sued for the
fine of £20 and judgment obtained against him with costs.</p>

<p>14th August, 1766. A Committee having been appointed to
examine and report upon the Theatre, and having done so, were now
authorised to apply to the Court of Common Council for permission to
pull down the same, and to treat with that Court for the purchase of
the ground, for which the Company paid the City £3 per annum under
an old lease.</p>

<p>3rd November, 1767. The City Comptroller having requested
the Company to make an offer for the site of the Theatre, it was
resolved that 30 years’ purchase (£90) be offered for the same.</p>

<p>7th February, 1769. A plan of the ground leased by the City
to the Company and on which the Theatre stood, having been
prepared by Mr. George Dance, Clerk of the Works to the City, it
was laid before the Court, and the City sold the fee simple to
the Company for £90. Would that one could buy City freeholds
at the same rate now!</p>

<p>2nd September, 1783. Mr. Sylvanus Hall, of Paternoster Row,
Carpenter, proposed to take a lease of the ground on which the
Theatre stood, to take down the whole building, and to erect two
dwelling houses on the site similar to those he had already built in
Monkwell Street. The lease to commence at Christmas, 1784, and to
be for 61 years at £10 ground rent. He also proposed to pay the
Company £20 for the old materials of the Theatre and to clear the
same away. To all these propositions the Court agreed, and Mr. Hall
paid a guinea as earnest money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span></p>

<p>1st February, 1785. Mr. Hall having pulled down the Theatre,
the Clerk was instructed to write to him for the £20 for the old
materials which he had removed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4th October, 1791. There being a sufficient number of Members present to
form a Court of Assistants, thoˀ no such Court was called, the Master took the sense of
the Members present, as an adjournment from the last Court of Assistants, whether the
Company should go out in the usual procession the ensuing Lord Mayor’s day, when on
the question being put, the same was resolved in the negative.</p>

<p>4th November, 1794. M<sup>r</sup> Thomas Holehouse who was on the 1<sup>st</sup> July last
elected on the Livery of this Company, but had refused to take upon him the same,
without shewing any cause to the Contrary, and against whom an Action had been
commenced for the recovery of Twenty Pounds the penalty incurred by such his refusal,
this day attended and paid the said sum of Twenty pounds together with the costs of the
said Action.</p></div>

<p>9th November, 1795. The following Circular was distributed
amongst the Livery at the dinner this <span class="nowrap">day:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">The Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Barbers having
received information that many persons residing within the City of London carry
on the Trade of a Barber and Hair dresser without being free of this Company to
the great prejudice of the Members and the rights of the Company Do hereby
give notice that they have come to a resolution to prosecute all persons carrying on
the trade of a Barber or Hair dresser within the said City not being free of this
Company and they request the assistance of their Members for that purpose for the
benefit of the Company and Trade at large; any information to their Clerk at the
Hall will be duly attended to.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="pr30pc">By order of Court,</span><br />
<span class="smcap pr1">Edw<sup>d</sup> Grose Smith,</span><br />

</div>

<p>9th November, 1796. The By-Laws of the Company having
been found, on the opinion of Mr. Serjeant Adair, insufficient to<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
enforce the payment of fines for the refusal to serve various offices,
a new set was drawn up by the Clerk, and submitted to and approved
by the Court, who ordered the Clerk to get the same confirmed
and allowed by the Lord Chancellor and two Chief Justices, but this
was never done.</p>

<p>5th September, 1797. The Mahogany table now in the Court
Room was made about this time. There is a tradition that the
bulb-shaped end of it was a portion of the old dissecting table
used by the Surgeons. If so, its latter days are more cheerful than
its first.</p>

<p>1796 to 1799. Several Barbers were prosecuted for exercising
their Trade within the limits of the Company’s Charters and brought
to terms, generally they became freemen, and then were compelled to
come on to the livery; in other cases the barbers removed out
the jurisdiction, and paid the costs.</p>

<p>18th May, 1802. The Commissioners for the Public Lottery
having advertised for a place in which to hold the lotteries, the Court
decided to send in proposals offering the use of the Hall (under certain
restrictions) for the next three lotteries for Six hundred guineas, but
the offer was not accepted.</p>

<p>1st August, 1809. A case was submitted to the Attorney
General (Sir R. Gibbs) who gave an opinion that the freemen of
the Company were exempt from serving on Juries, but not from
serving as Constables.</p>

<p>4th February, 1812. A memorial signed by four freemen of
the Company was presented to the Court, the purport of which was<span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
that the memorialists having been summoned to act as Ward Constables
had refused to serve, and that thereupon actions had been brought
against them, which, being tried before Lord Ellenborough, the
verdicts were against them and they were ordered to pay the costs
(£333 9<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>). The memorialists alleging that they defended the
actions for the benefit of the Company and really to uphold its
privileges, prayed that they might be reimbursed the costs, which,
however, the Court declined to accede to, but ordered that £12, which
had been paid to the Company for copies of the Charters, should
be refunded.</p>

<p>1814. The Churchwardens of St. Olave, Silver Street, having
assessed the Hall at £172, they were requested to attend the next
Court which they did, and the following delightful method of settling
these matters is recommended to the Authorities nowadays.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1st November, 1814. The parish officers of Saint Olave Silver Street attended
&amp; stated to the Court that the Vestry of that Parish had taken the subject of the Poor
rate into consideration, and considering the great increase of the rate they left it to the
Company to say what they were agreeable to be rated at; the Court proposed to say
£100 per annum; the gentlemen (having withdrawn) were then called in and informed
of such proposal, with which they cordially acquiesced.</p>

<p>2nd April, 1816. Alexander Rowland the younger [of Macassar oil fame] of
Kirby Street Hatton Garden, Barber was admitted to the Livery.</p></div>

<p>3rd May, 1825. The Livery stand, being in a decayed and
useless condition, was ordered to be sold.</p>

<p>2nd May, 1826. But as a purchaser could not be found, the
Master offered to give £5 for it, which was accepted, and this, together
with an additional £5, was ordered to be given to the Committee for
the Relief of Distressed Manufacturers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span></p>

<p>5th February, 1861. Mr. John Atkinson gave £100 consols
for the purpose of distributing the dividends thereof in the purchase of
Bibles and Prayer Books for the poor members of the Company.</p>

<p>7th February, 1862. Mr. John Atkinson’s Will reciting a
munificent bequest to the Company is set out in the minutes of this date.</p>

<p>3rd February, 1863. A Statement of the property left by Mr.
John Atkinson is recorded in a letter from the Solicitors to his Trustees
directed to the Court, and entered in the minutes of this date.</p>

<p class="dropcap">
The Barbers’ Company is ranked the seventeenth
in order of the City Companies, and is the
fifth after the “Twelve great Companies,” the
thirteenth being the Dyers, fourteenth Brewers,
fifteenth Leathersellers, sixteenth Pewterers, seventeenth
Barbers, eighteenth Cutlers, etc.</p>

<p>The question of precedency in former times gave rise to
many contentions between the City Guilds, and the Barber-Surgeons
seem to have had some experience in these quarrels: the City
pageants, processions, and public attendances at church, were
numerous in the days of the Tudors and Stuarts, and at most of
these the Livery Companies attended, each guild jealously striving
to keep its place, and no doubt to advance its position whenever
opportunity arose.</p>

<p>There are extant, lists of the Companies in the City books,
in which our Company takes various positions; and Stow, having
incorporated one of these lists in his Survey, has given it an<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
authority as a table of precedence which it was never intended to
possess; he furnishes a list of the Companies attending the Lord
Mayor’s feast, 23rd Henry VIII (1531), and places the Barbers
as the thirty-second, whereas at that time they were undoubtedly
the twenty-eighth.</p>

<p>1516. The first authentic reference to our Company’s standing
is found in <i>Letter-Book N.</i> leaf 5 (January, 1516), where it is
ordained that the Barbers, although they claimed of their ancient
right to be the seventeenth Company, yet were adjudged to take
the twenty-eighth place, following the Cordwainers, and preceding
the Paynter-Stainers.</p>

<p>1532. This order was probably in force until February,
1532, when the Barbers got back their old position (<i>Repertory</i> 8,
leaf 272) and an officer was directed to wait on the Pewterers to
“shewe theym that the seyd Company of Barbours Surgeons be
Restored ageyn to their olde Rowme.” Three months later (May,
1532), the Barbers were “taken down one,” and directed to occupy
the eighteenth place.</p>

<p>1533. In February, 1533 (<i>Letter-Book O.</i> <i>fo.</i> 213), is a
record which is somewhat puzzling, as, altogether ignoring the
orders of February and May, 1532, it is stated that the Barber-Surgeons
had petitioned to be restored to their old place of
seventeenth Company, from which it is said they were dispossessed
about sixteen years back (evidently alluding to the order of January,
1516), “so that they be nowe the xxix or xxx<sup>th</sup> Companye yn
thordre of such goynges,” etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps the orders of February and May, 1532, had been
disregarded by the other guilds, and our Company forcibly ousted
from their rightful position, so that this is in effect an application<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>
for a confirmatory order, which was granted, and thus they were
again fixed as the seventeenth Company.</p>

<p>1534. The Barbers must have given some offence to the
Civic authorities in 1534, for in October of that year (<i>Repertory</i> 9,
leaf 79) the last-named order was repealed, and they were put back
again to the twenty-eighth place, and further the Company were
ordered that they “shall no more goo yn pˀcessyons, standyngꝭ,
Rydyngꝭ, goyngꝭ, and other assembles from hensfurth, tyll it be
otherwyse ordered by thys coˀrte.”</p>

<p>1535. This vacillation on the part of the Court of Aldermen
in settling our position, was not yet at an end, for in March, 1535,
we were again placed seventeenth, to come before the Cutlers and
after the Pewterers, and this order was confirmed no less than four
times in 1535, and twice in 1536.</p>

<p>1604. At a Royal Procession on the 15th March, 1604, our
Company got misplaced by some of the Marshals, and this led to
another application to the Court of Aldermen, whereupon a peremptory
order was made that the Barber-Surgeons should stand
sixteenth in precedence. This order is set out in full elsewhere (see
page <a href="#Page_195">195</a>); the sixteenth place was then accorded to us in consequence
of the Stockfishmongers, who formerly held the twelfth
place, having been dissolved, whereby the Barber-Surgeons went up
one: the Clothworkers who, at that time were the thirteenth
Company, then became the twelfth.</p>

<p>Some short time afterwards, the Dyers, who had been the
eighteenth Company, got the thirteenth place, and we reverted to
our old position of seventeenth Company in which we still continue.</p>

<p>1606. An attempt to misplace us was made in July, 1606,
but this was successfully resisted. (See <a href="#Page_116">p.&nbsp;116</a>.)</p>

<h2>COURT OF ASSISTANTS.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t.jpg" width="90" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
The constitution of the governing body of the Company
has grown up in the course of time from one Prime
Master or Ruler to a Master with three Wardens
and twenty Assistants, forming a Court of twenty-four
members.</p>

<p>We gather from the earliest records, that the business of the
Company was then transacted by the meeting together in Common
Hall, of the whole fraternity (which probably included both freemen
and liverymen), under the presidency of a single Master, who, as in
the case of Richard le Barber in 1308, was invested with the supervision
of the craft, and power to make search and scrutiny, and to
punish offenders.</p>

<p>In 1376 two Masters were appointed to rule the craft, while
in 1388 we find that two Masters and two “Surveyors” formed the
governing body.</p>

<p>In 1416 is recorded the admission of five Masters, three of
whom are described as “Barbitonsores” (<i>i.e.</i>, Barbers proper) and
two as “Masters of the Barbers exercising the faculty of Surgery.”<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
In 1428 there were four Masters, two of each class, and this number
was the governing body at the time of Edward IV’s Charter of
Incorporation, in 1462.</p>

<p>As has been elsewhere remarked, this Charter provides for the
appointment of two Masters only, and they to be skilled in Surgery, to
be chosen by twelve Electors taken from the Commonalty; but as our
records preserve the names of four Masters elected in that year, and so
on ever since in unbroken succession, there cannot be any doubt but
that (the Charter dealing almost entirely with the regulation of matters
surgical) the two Masters of the “Barbers side” were left to be elected
in accordance with old custom, or under the By-laws which the
Company were, by their Charter, empowered to make.</p>

<p>At what period a Court of Assistants was created in our
Company is unknown, but I am inclined to think the date is about
1480 to 1500. The four “Masters or Governors” (answering to our
“Master and three Wardens”) were chosen out of the Commonalty by
twelve electors yearly, and do not, as seems by the lists preserved,
appear to have gone up annually by seniority as now they do, <i>i.e.</i>, from
third Warden to second, and so on. Those who had served as second,
third, or fourth Governors, if not chosen to higher office the next year,
as a general rule took their places again as simple liverymen; whilst
those who had served as Prime or Chief Governor were, at the expiry
of their term of office, designated “Ancient Masters,” and these, with
some past Wardens, having become qualified by experience in the
affairs of the Company would naturally be consulted by the ruling
Governors who sought their “assistance” and advice, and thus grow
up into a Court of <span class="nowrap">Assistants<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> (nearly always in early time spelt<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
“Assistance”) and be recognised to a great extent as a power in the
direction of the Company’s business.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of Assistants is in the By-laws settled by
Sir Thomas More in 1530, though throughout these By-laws the
actual ruling power was evidently in the four Masters or Governors.
The Assistants are here twice referred to, in one case where it is
enacted that the Masters shall not admit a “fforen” to the freedom
without the assent of the “xxiiij<sup>ti</sup> assistentes,” and in another place
they are to have, with the Masters, the election of the Livery.</p>

<p>The Act 32 Henry VIII is silent as to Assistants, vesting all
power in the Masters or Governors. In 1557 at one of the Courts
twenty-one Assistants and four Masters attended, and at a Court held
19th July, 1595, the names of twenty-five Assistants are recorded.
The number seems to have varied with the times, the full Court,
however, never exceeding four Masters and thirty-two Assistants.
The Assistants have always been elected by the Court, and the custom
became in time to choose the senior liveryman whenever a vacancy
occurred, though there does not appear to have been at any time a
by-law to that effect, and indeed this practice has been departed from
on very many occasions.</p>

<p>The Election of Masters prior to the year 1633 was on the
Monday next before the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle
(Aug. 24); from 1633 to 1745 it was held on the third Thursday in
August, and since 1745 it has been held on the second Thursday in
August.</p>

<p>The ancient practice was for the whole body of the livery to be
summoned to the Hall in their livery gowns, hoods and caps on the
Monday at 8 o’clock in the morning “at the furthest” to whom the<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
Masters, sitting in Court, declared the cause of their assembling; this
done, the Masters retired, and the livery, sitting there, chose twelve of
their number to be “Electors,” of whom six were to be “expert
Surgeons,” and four at least must never have served the office of
Master or Governor. The Clerk then called the twelve Electors out
(the rest of the livery remaining in the Hall). The Masters then
delivered to the Electors the “Bills of Election,” each Master
nominating two Barbers and two Surgeons, so that sixteen in all were
nominated, and, after administering to them the oath prescribed, the
Electors retired to a private room apart to make their choice. Should
the Electors deem that one or more of themselves ought to have been
put in nomination, they were to send for the Masters who were bound
to withdraw such person or persons, and choose others in their place.
The Bills were to be made out in accordance with seniority, but the
Electors were not bound to choose by seniority. Having made their
choice, the Electors sent for the Masters and delivered to them a Bill
with the names of the four persons selected, and these names were
(under a heavy penalty) to be kept secret until after the “dener.”</p>

<p>The whole Company then proceeded in state to the Church of
St. Olave, Silver Street (after the Great Fire to St. Alban, Wood
Street), maids strewing the way with flowers. At Church there was a
“goodly masse” celebrated, and in later times a “devyne sˀrvice,”
which, being ended, the parson and some of the church officials had
customary fees and returned with the Company to the Hall to celebrate
the Election dinner. The feast over, the outgoing Masters, according
to “auncient order,” walked about the table, each bearing a garland
and placing it on the head of the member who had been chosen to fill
his place in the year ensuing. If anyone elected happened to be
absent, his garland was placed on the head of one of the Ancient
Masters as proxy, and the newly-elected Masters were sworn on the<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
Holy Evangelists to the due execution of their offices, absentees being
sworn at the next Court.</p>

<p>The Election dinners were held at any early hour in the afternoon
(1 or 2&nbsp;p.m.) and were generally followed by a play or a dance,
sometimes both; the wives of the livery and Assistants were present
at the dinner, and the latter had their apprentices in attendance waiting
at table.</p>

<p>In 1633 the mode of choosing the Electors was varied as
follows: a “fair ballating box” with two cells therein, one labelled
“Surgeons” and the other “Barbers” was placed upon the table,</p>


<div class="center">
<table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="taj plhir1">Into <i>each</i> cell the Master put the names of two Ancient Masters, and drew one out of each</td><td class="tar vab">2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="taj plhir1">The second and third Governors put into <i>each</i> cell the names of six Assistants, and the Master drew three out of each</td><td class="tar vab">6</td></tr>
<tr><td class="taj plhir1">The fourth Governor put into <i>each</i> cell the names of four liverymen and the Master drew two out of each</td><td class="tar vab">4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal plhir1"></td><td class="tar btbd ptb03">12</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p class="ti0em">The twelve so drawn constituted the Electors, and the proceedings
were then much the same as has been before described.</p>

<p>The new Masters or Governors commenced their duties
immediately upon being sworn.</p>

<p>From the earliest period the custom has been to hold the
monthly and ordinary Courts on Tuesdays, but the meetings do not<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
seem to have taken place on any definite or fixed days, numerous
Courts being held at irregular intervals and frequently on Mondays.
“Courts of Assistants,” as distinguished from Monthly and special
Courts, were, in early times, for some reason or other, particularly
prohibited from being held on Tuesdays, there being several orders
and by-laws to this effect, but why, I do not know.</p>

<p>In the year 1557 twenty Courts were held. In 1572 forty-one
Courts, the average attendance at which was twelve. In 1599 forty-six
Courts assembled. At the intermediate Courts a great deal of
important as well as minor business was transacted, including the
admissions and presentations of freemen and apprentices, the examination
of Surgeons and Sea Surgeons, and a great variety of business
connected with the medical service of the army and navy.</p>

<p>Previous to the separation in 1745, the office of Master was
supposed to be, and generally was, held by a Barber and a Surgeon
alternately, the Wardens being chosen in like manner, any member
not practising as a Surgeon being accounted a Barber, whatever
his trade or occupation might be.</p>

<p>Great importance has at all times been attached to the question
of precedence in sitting at table and in speaking in Court, and many
have been the rules enacted, and the disputes and jealousies which
have arisen between members of the Court on this question.</p>

<p>Some of the powers executed by the Masters of old and by
the Court of Assistants in later times have been those which now are
peculiar to Courts of Law, <i>e.g.</i>, the settlement of disputes upon every
conceivable question, the imposition of fines, and their recovery by
distress levied by the Beadle, the summary committal of offenders to
gaol, and the issuing of orders for their release, the prohibition of<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>
actions and suits at common law (if commenced by a freeman without
leave of the Court), the inhibition of members from practising their
profession, and the infliction of corporal punishment upon unruly
freemen and apprentices.</p>

<p>The Court as now existing, consists of four Masters or Governors
and twenty Assistants, appointed under the provisions of the Act 18
George II, cap. xv. By this Act the election of the Masters or
Governors is in the Court and takes place on the second Thursday
in August, but alas! without the ancient ceremonies of attending
Church, crowning with garlands, and&mdash;may I add?&mdash;the Election dinner
for the Livery.</p>

<p>As will be seen elsewhere, there have been frequent disturbances
at the Courts, and there are numerous entries of Assistants,
Wardens, and Past Masters having been expelled the Court and
sometimes dismissed from the Livery as well, for their misconduct
or quarrelsome behaviour. Instances of impertinence and abuse
by freemen and liverymen before the Court, are also by no means
rare, and in these cases condign punishment by imprisonment or
fine was invariably meted out.</p>

<p>21st August, 1626. Serjeant Clowes was elected Master, but
it seems his election was called in question, as it was the turn for a
Barber this year, and it was moved that the electors should be fined
for breach of the ordinance in choosing a Surgeon, but the Court
decided not to do so. There was evidently a dislike to Mr. Clowes
on the part of some of the Company, as the Wardens of the Yeomanry
were on the 20th September, fined 40<i>s.</i> for refusing, or
neglecting to carry the Standing Cups before him and the Wardens
of the Livery on the Election day.</p>

<p>1638. Serjeant Clowes was again elected Master.</p>

this Court did order that M<sup>r</sup> Serjeant Clowes shall acknowledge that in his anger and
passion he did speake some words to the wrong of this Court, and this being done
this Order to be annihilated.</p>

<p>22nd September, 1642. Alsoe for the more peaceable treaty and discussing

<h2>THE COMMONALTY.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t-dec.jpg" width="220" height="257" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap3 mt4em">
<span class="smcap">The</span> admission to membership in the
Company has ever been by servitude,
patrimony, or redemption, and
the fines and fees payable have
varied so much at different periods
in our history, and have frequently
been so capricious, that no attempt
has been made to tabulate them,
though references will be made here
and there to the prevailing fees of
the period. The fees for apprentices
have always been of a nominal
description, and generally so of freemen, though, in olden time, the
Court, as became the Masters of the mystery of “bleeding,” not
unfrequently bled a new member by a substantial fine on admission,
but also put him to the expense of a dinner into the bargain.</p>

<p class="ti0em tac fs80 htmlonly">The initial letter <span class="antiqua">T</span> is reduced from one in the Audit Book 1614–15.</p>

<p>An ample fine, suited to the period, has always been taken from
the Liverymen who were, in the days of the Tudors and Stuarts<span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
a comparatively small section of the Company, and rarely exceeded
fifty in number; they were always chosen from the more substantial
of the Yeomanry, and if on election they refused “to take the
clothing,” as was frequently the case, a heavy penalty was imposed,
which, if not paid, the unhappy yeoman was forthwith committed
to the Compter, where, upon reflection, he generally came to the
conclusion to submit. It is right, however, to state that at all
times the Court have, in cases where the proposed Liveryman was
actually a poor man, remitted the fine, and allowed him to continue
a yeoman; on the other hand, contumacious refusal was invariably
met in the firmest manner and conquered.</p>

<p>The practice of calling up yeomen to the Livery was at times
resorted to as a means of putting the Company into funds, and as
these calls generally took place at periods of national trouble, when
the coffers of the Company had been emptied by the King or the
Parliament, the intended Liverymen were themselves not unfrequently
in sore straits, and great contentions arose.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty years ago the practice of enforcing
these fines was in regular operation, but since then it has been attended
with varying success; not that the Company has not by law the power
of enforcement, but a prejudice had grown up against the system, and
the Court has been unwilling to sanction a resort to extremities.</p>

<p>Early in the present century three or four actions were brought
against freemen to recover penalties of £20 for refusing to accept the
Livery; in one case which was ripe for trial the Company withdrew the
record and paid the costs, and the others seem to have been abandoned.</p>

<p>All freemen on being sworn were liable to pay “quarterage,”
which has been from the earliest period, and still is, 2<i>s.</i> per annum<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span><span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span>
On a man coming up for admission he was “presented,” that is,
seen by the Court who enquired into his position, knowledge, fitness
and general qualifications, and if approved he paid his fees and
was sworn. Some of the earlier forms of oath will be seen on
reference to the Ordinances, and that used up to a very recent
period was as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">You shall swear That you shall be True and Loyal to our Sovereign Lady
Queen Victoria and faithful and true in all lawful things unto the Corporation and
Company of the Mystery of Barbers of London, whereof you are now made free,
and accordingly be obedient to the Master and Governors thereof: and as much as in
you lieth maintain amity and unity therein; and obey observe and perform all the
lawful rules statutes and ordinances thereof; and be proportionably contributory to
the best of your power, to all lawful or reasonable charges contributions and payments
belonging or necessarily appertaining to you to bear and pay as other Brethren of
the same Company do. And also you shall obey all manner of summons or warnings
done, or to be made by the Clerk Beadle or other officer of the said Company
thereunto assigned in the name of the Master and Governors, having no lawful or
reasonable excuse to the contrary. All these articles you shall duly, truly, fully and
faithfully observe, perform and keep to the best of your power. So help you God.</p></div>

<p>A few years since, this oath was changed into a declaration,
the words “You shall declare” being substituted for “You shall
swear.”</p>

<p>It was generally the practice, when a member wished to be
translated to another Company or entirely discharged, that he should
pay a fine for his dismission. In 1724, Mr. John Bamber, a Surgeon,
informing the Court that he intended to practise as a Physician
and to become a Member of the College of Physicians prayed
for his discharge, which was granted to him on payment of thirty
guineas, and there are other entries to the like effect.</p>

<p>The regulations for the governance of the members are
very fully contained in the Ordinances referred to elsewhere, and<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
it would therefore be tedious to further allude to them here. On
a perusal of the extracts from the minutes, etc., many curious
particulars will be seen concerning both freemen and liverymen
who were liable to be expelled for not being “able” (<i>i.e.</i>, solvent)
and also for not attending in their livery gowns and hoods upon
summons. There are many and often reminders to the livery to
appear in their gowns with their hoods upon their shoulders, and
there are also cases in which individuals were forbidden to wear
their gowns and hoods by way of punishment. The dress of the
livery has been well described in Herbert’s Livery Companies, and
Planche’s Costume, and we can see it in our great Holbein picture,
though the dresses worn on that occasion were of a much richer
description than those in daily use.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the Livery were constantly going out in
procession in days of old. There were the services at St. Paul’s on
Christmas and Candlemas days, the Lord Mayor’s procession, the
setting of the watch on Midsummer Eve, the celebration of 5th
November, the anniversary of Gowrie’s Conspiracy, the Election
Service at St. Olave’s, Silver Street, days of thanksgiving and
humiliation, Royal progresses and Civic pageants. To all of these
the Livery were bidden to go by precept, and on neglect of the
summons were fined. In many cases certain of them were appointed
to ride on horseback with velvet coats and chains of gold about their
necks, and when not so apparelled they appeared in their gowns of
black and scarlet, with their hoods upon their shoulders. What would
we not give for a photograph of one of these gorgeous scenes wherein
we should see the “liverie of our solempne and grete fraternite”
riding “ayenst,” say, Queen Elizabeth in 1599?</p>

<p>Our earlier records of freemen are unfortunately lost, the first
register commencing in the year 1551, but at Guildhall I have<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
discovered several admissions of freemen Barbers to the freedom
of the City, and here place a few of them upon record. The first
is in <span class="nowrap">1309:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

Farendon, John de Windsor and Henry de Durham, Aldermen, And gave to the
Commonalty 20<i>s.</i>, which the aforesaid Aldermen received.</p></div>

<p>Other entries are much in the same form, a few of which,
abridged, <span class="nowrap">follow:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="mt-05em">1309. John de Dodinghurst, Barber, admitted and sworn, etc.,

a mark.</p>

<p>1310. Ralph the Barber admitted, etc., 16th March; paid

<p><span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span></p>

<p>1311. John Syward, Barber, admitted, etc., Monday before
the feast of St. Edmund the King, at the instance of the Lord Walter,
Bishop of Winchester, Chancellor, “et ideo nichil dat ꝓ liᵬtate
habenda,” “and <i>therefore</i> gave nothing to have the freedom!”</p>

<p>1312. Ralph de Bosbery, Barber, admitted, etc., on Monday
in the feast of St. Valentine; paid half a mark.</p>

<p>1312. John de Fynceham, Barber, admitted, etc., 6th April;
paid 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>1312. Henry de la Chaumbre, Barber, admitted, etc., on
Monday in the vigil of the Assumption; paid half a mark.</p>

<p>1312. Thomas de Mangrave who was the apprentice of
Richard le Barber of Bread Street, was admitted on Wednesday
before the feast of St. James the Apostle, on the testimony of
Katherine, widow of the said Richard and of Robert de Gloucester,
the executors of his will; paid 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The “Richard le Barber” mentioned in the last entry was
Master of the Company in 1308.</p>

<p>The freemen were formerly enrolled in the “yeomanry” and
formed a minor fraternity within the Company (<i>see</i> the chapter on
the <a href="#YEOMANRY">Yeomanry</a>).</p>

<p>All freemen practising as journeymen or assistants, if Barbers,
Surgeons, or Barber-Surgeons were “sessed at the Hall,” that is,
their wages were settled for them by the Court, and entered in a
book, together with the period for which they agreed to serve, the
period being never less than one year nor more than three. These
men were often called “covenant servants,” but they paid quarterage,<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
and were entitled to all the privileges of freedom, excepting that
they could not take apprentices.</p>

<p>If a freemen desired to start in business, the By-laws of 1530
required that he should prove to the Court as an act precedent to his
so doing, that he was possessed of goods to the value of ten marks.</p>

<p>A certain class of members called “Foreign Brothers” are very
frequently alluded to in the Books, and it has been a matter of some
difficulty to ascertain what their status exactly was, but by collation of
numerous entries I have come to the conclusion that, with very few
exceptions, they were all of them practising Surgeons, and that they
had <i>not</i> been apprenticed to freemen of the Company. If practising
within the jurisdiction of the Company, they were compelled to join,
or else to forbear to practise, and it seems that on admission they were
required to satisfy the Court by the production of their Indentures of
apprenticeship to Country or other Surgeons that they had duly served
seven years, and to give ample proof of their skill and knowledge
before the Examiners; exceptions to the production of indentures were,
however, made in favour of those who came with recommendations
from persons of quality, or of such as had acquired eminence and
position in the profession. All sea surgeons were “Foreign Brothers”
and paid a fine (generally seven guineas) on admission, they also paid
quarterage as freemen, and when they resided within the jurisdiction
were subject to all the rules and ordinances of the Company as other
freemen, being frequently fined and imprisoned for malpractice, etc.,
though they were not entitled to the benefit of the charities, to come
to the dinners, or to confer the right of admission by patrimony upon
their sons, nor do they seem to have been necessarily free of the City.
Many Surgeons practising in the Country became Foreign Brothers
for the sake of the diplomas granted at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span></p>

<p>There are a few instances of “Barbers” being compelled
to become Foreign Brothers, for which I am unable to give an
explanation, unless they be errors of description by the Clerk for
“Barber-Surgeons.”</p>

<p>Every freeman on admission formerly paid 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and every
apprentice on “presentation” 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> For many years the names of
these persons are entered in the Audit Books, and thus it has been
possible to ascertain the number admitted extending over a considerable
period.</p>

<p>It appears that from the year 1603 to 1674, 3,479 persons
were admitted to the freedom, an average of about 48 per annum;
and 9,554 apprentices were presented, an average of about 133 per
annum. The greatest number of freemen admitted was in the
year 1647 when 82 came on, and the least in 1666 when but 23 were
admitted. With apprentices the greatest number presented was in
the year 1629 when there were 219, and the least again in the
year of the Great Fire when there were but 54.</p>

<p>Between 1674 and 1745, about 75 freemen and 162 apprentices
would be the yearly average.</p>

<p>After the separation in 1745, and indeed down to the beginning
of this century, a respectable average was maintained, being about
40 freemen and 60 apprentices per annum.</p>

<p>In the hundred years between 1746 and 1845, 2,964 persons
were admitted to the freedom and 4,298 apprentices were presented,
being an average of about 30 of the former and 43 of the latter
for each year. The least number of freemen coming on was in
1845, when only 5 were admitted, and of apprentices in 1844, when
but 4 were presented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span></p>

<p>The apprentices always seem to have been a fruitful source
of trouble both to their Masters and to the Company, and numerous
are the entries of their floggings and imprisonments. The term
of servitude was generally seven years, but in a few instances it
was eight and even nine, the age at which boys were taken was
usually fourteen, and before the Indentures were sealed the boy
was “presented” to the Court that it might be seen that he was
clean and not deformed or diseased. If approved, the Indentures
were executed and recorded, and in all cases the apprentice actually
lived with his Master, who covenanted to find him meat, drink,
apparel, lodging and all other necessaries according to the custom
of the City. If the boy’s master died or for other reasons was
unable to continue his business, it became necessary for him to be
“turned over” to another master, free of the Company, and that
such turn over should be approved and recorded, otherwise the
apprentice was disqualified for his freedom. When his term
expired the Master brought him to the Hall and “testified”
to his faithful service, whereupon he became entitled to the
freedom on payment of a nominal fine. Sometimes Masters
refused to make their apprentices free, in which cases the Court
enquired into the circumstances, and acted in accordance with the
merits of the case.</p>

<p>From the earliest times the custom has prevailed to admit
women to the freedom, mostly by apprenticeship, but also by
patrimony, and these freewomen bound their apprentices, both boys
and girls, at the Hall; of course the ladies were not admitted
to the livery, but otherwise they had the same privileges as
freemen so far as the same were compatible with their sex.
At the present time (1890) there is one freewoman of the Barbers’
Company.</p>

the Liverymen were not to appear at the Hall in their gowns and<span class="pagenum" title="275"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span>
hoods on Christmas, Twelfth and Candlemas days “as formerlie
they were accustomed to doe,” but at their seats at St. Paul’s instead.</p>

<p>13th September, 1621. The livery was generally composed
of an equal number of Barbers and of Surgeons; on this day it
was <span class="nowrap">ordered&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">That at the next choise of a new Lyvery there shalbe chosen a Barber more
than a Surgeon for that M<sup>r</sup> Kellett hath not accepted of the place as yett, if he shall
not accept thereof.</p></div>

<p>1636. A great many Liverymen were chosen this year,
apparently for the purpose of assisting by their fines, the fund for the
building of the Anatomical Theatre; from various entries at this
period it would seem that when a freeman desired to be excused taking
the Livery, he was obliged to take an oath before the Masters of his
inability to pay the fine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>19th May, 1637. This Court upon divers treatise with Abraham Purrott a
brother of this Companie being chosen into the livery by a former Court &amp; he being

give a peece of plate of v<sup>li</sup> to this house as his gift in full satisfaction of all his fines &amp;

<p>Several others were from time to time similarly fined, both in
the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2nd August, 1737. At this Court Robert Young who was the apprentice of
James Phillips Surgeon was admitted into the freedom of the Company by service and

M<sup>r</sup> Phillips out of his own bounty and a just sense of the diligent and faithfull services of
the said Robert Young during his Apprenticeship did not only pay the charges of the
said M<sup>r</sup> Young’s freedom but did likewise bestow upon him his fine for the Livery being
ten pounds.</p>

<h2>THE <a id="YEOMANRY"></a>YEOMANRY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t4.jpg" width="90" height="90" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">The</span> Yeomanry of the Barber-Surgeons appear to
have had a most chequered existence, having been
“established” and “put downe” several times,
until finally they appear to have died out both
in constitution and in name.</p>

<p>The Yeomanry answered exactly to the class of Members who
are now styled “Freemen,” and for a long period were the most
numerous body in the Company. In early times the numbers of
the Livery or Clothing were strictly limited, and under the Tudors
and Stuarts rarely exceeded fifty, but as the persons who were compelled
to take up their freedom, and those who came in voluntarily<span class="pagenum" title="277"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span>
or by patrimony and servitude have always been a numerous section,
it appears to have been considered politic to give a constitution to
these inferior members of the Mystery, and consequently a Yeomanry,
or Company within the Company was set up, and to this the new
freeman was admitted after he had been presented and sworn before
the Masters or Governors of the Clothing.</p>

<p>The Court of the Company framed the Ordinances for the
Yeomanry, and whilst delegating to them many of their own privileges,
as, for instance, the power to levy fines, and to summarily commit
offenders to prison, they always seem to have retained a very tight and
jealous hand over them, and were constantly interfering with the
Wardens of the Yeomanry.</p>

<p>The Yeomanry had their own four Wardens and Court of
Assistants, their Beadle and mace, common box, standing cups and
other silver plate, their annual dinner, and sometimes, when in a
flourishing condition, no less than four dinners in the year, their
“corrector” for apprentices, and they also possessed the choice
privilege of collecting the quarterage from their members. Under
such auspicious circumstances, it could hardly be otherwise than that,
in process of time, they should become both presumptuous and
audacious and thus provoke inevitable collision with the Ruling
body of the Company.</p>

<p>The Wardens of the Yeomanry at one period had designated
themselves, or certainly encouraged others to describe them, as
“The Wardens of the Barber-Surgeons,” an assumption not to be
tolerated, and, like their Masters on the Clothing, had been accustomed
to go to their homes (after their gatherings and feasts) in state,
accompanied by a “trayne or traynes”; these acts of presumption
called forth the restraining order of the 15th September, 1588 (<i>vide<span class="pagenum" title="278"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></span>
post</i>). Later on we find that they went “in searche to see what
serˀvnts some ffremen of the Companie had, w<sup>ch</sup> they ought not to do,”
they gave way to too much feasting and arbitrarily exercised their
powers of fine and imprisonment, all which offences brought them
reprimands, and somewhere about the year 1604 their temporary
extinguishment. They were, however, soon after re-erected, but in
the year 1635 permanently “disestablished and disendowed.”</p>

<p>Although the Constitution of the “Yeomanry” was then
abolished, the appellation was retained for over 200 years after, though
merely as a traditional distinctive name synonymous with that of
“freemen.” Thus, the whifflers for Lord Mayor’s day were always
chosen out of the “Yeomanry,” and members of the “Yeomanry”
are continually spoken of as being chosen into the Livery.</p>

<p>In the Audit Book, 1847–1848, this ancient term is used for the
last time in respect of the receipts for quarterage, after this the
designation becomes “freemen.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>19th September, 1552. It is condescendyd and agreed that there shalbe no
more yomanry of the said Company of Barbors Surgeons.</p></div>

<p>1st October, 1555. It was agreed “that the yomanrye of the
sayed Company of Barbors and Surgeons shalbe establisshed and
set up agayne and be in as full strenght force and power as ever
yt was before the plucking downe of the same,” and articles or
ordinances for the Yeomanry were enacted. As, however, these
articles are excessively verbose, the following descriptions and
extracts will <span class="nowrap">suffice:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Article 1. Out of the Yeomanry were to be chosen four Wardens
annually, and named respectively, the uppermost, second, third and
youngest Wardens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="279"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span></p>

<p>Article 2. One of the Yeomanry to be appointed Beadle of
the Yeomanry to execute summonses, etc.</p>

<p>Article 3. The Wardens of the Yeomanry to bring in once a
year to the Masters and Governors of the Clothing, an account of
monies remaining in their hands to be delivered to the new Wardens,
and to be “kept and bestowed as they w<sup>t</sup>in themselves shall thinke
yt meete and convenyent to the helpe and comforte of them w<sup>t</sup>in the
yomanry of Barbors and Surgeons.” The Wardens were also to
present the new Wardens to the Masters or Governors for approval
within eight days after being chosen. The Masters or Governors
were to “have nothinge to dooe withe the monye of the yomanry.”</p>

<p>Article 4. If the Masters or Governors should borrow any
monies of the Yeomanry they were to repay on a day to be agreed
upon “the saved som̄e so borrowed w<sup>t</sup> thanks geving.”</p>

<p>Article 5. The Wardens on the day of Election of Masters or
Governors of the Clothing <span class="nowrap">shall&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">come to the dynner at the hall in their best apparrell at the daye appointed

wardein of the yomanry shall beare the cupp before the yongest governor of the clothinge
in knowledging of the setting up of the yomanrye agayne.</p></div>

<p>In the event of sickness or lawful absence, others were to be
appointed to this duty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And furthermore that noen of the wardeins of the yomanrye of barbors and
surgeons doo presume to goo aboute to make searche to see in anye of the Companyes

taken or justelye proved that they doo soo, to forfaycte at every tyme so doying to the
hall vj<sup>li</sup> xiij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d.</sup></p></div>

<p>Article 6. The Wardens of the Yeomanry were to collect the
quarterage of freemen (3<i>d.</i> per quarter) and of “fforyners” (6<i>d.</i> per
quarter), and duly pay same over to the Masters and Governors, and
books of account were to be kept by the Wardens. <span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In
practice this article was varied, as the Yeomanry kept the quarterage
and “compounded” with the Masters for a fixed annual sum.</p>

<p>Article 7. The Masters were to pay the Wardens of the
Yeomanry £4 which had been “advanced by them in 1543 for
provysyon of wheete for the Cytie,” and which sum had been
recently refunded by the City.</p>

<p>Article 8. The Yeomanry were to have the use of the chamber
“where the Lecture ys reade every Tewysday” whenever they please
to consult therein.</p>

<p>Article 9. These Articles were to be written on parchment,
sealed and delivered to the Wardens of the Yeomanry.</p>

<p>Article 10. The Masters were to give notice to the Wardens
of the Yeomanry of any rules which they from time to time should
make touching the craft.</p>

<p>Article 11. The rules and ordinances of the Company were to
be read to the Yeomanry three times in every year, viz.: at Candlemas,
in May and at Lammas.</p>

<p>Article 12. The Yeomanry were to obey all the rules and
ordinances now made or to be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="281"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span></p>

<p>16th October, 1555. The first four Wardens of the Yeomanry
were presented to the Masters, their names being Edward Hewet,
John Surbut, George Corraunte (Corron) and Thomas Buston (Burston).</p>

<p>Warren and Wyllet must have been sent straight off to prison,
as a further minute states that on the same day “after diner,” Warren
was brought up out of the Compter for examination.</p>

<p>On the 29th May, Wyllet made submission and was released
from prison.</p>

<p>19th September, 1570. Warren and Wyllet seem to have
been cantankerous brethren, for they were complained of by the
Wardens of the Yeomanry for refusing to take upon themselves the
office of Wardens to which they had been elected.</p>

<p>7th October, 1572. Wyllet is again complained of for going
to law with another member of the Company without license from the
Masters, to which he pleaded that under a statute 19 Henry VII,
cap. viii, he could lawfully do so. The result of this contention is not
expressly stated, though there is not the least doubt but that Wyllet
revisited the Compter, and ultimately withdrew his suit.</p>

<p>5th March, 1573. It was <span class="nowrap">ordered&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">That where there hath ben an order that the whole bodye of the yeomanrye of

great trouble, and divers inconvenyences grewe thereoff as absence from sˀrvice and

<p>6th October, 1573. Here was a controvˀsy betweene the wardens of the

the Audytoures would not allowe that w<sup>ch</sup> was required by the said late wardens for

they should be allowed xvj<sup>s</sup> and they to beare the reste on theire owne chargeis and so to
be ffrendꝭ and Lovers w<sup>th</sup> quietnes.</p>

<p>6th June, 1577. Here also the wardens of the yeomanry were comaunded for
good and urgent Cawse to bring in there graunt from the maisters of there yomanry
against the next Co<sup>r</sup>te Daie for that they did take more Quarteridge then by the Lawe
they might do and also contrary to there saide graunte and in breche of the same they
went after a sort in searche to see what serˀvnts some ffremen of the Companie had w<sup>ch</sup>

<p>9th October, 1579. At this Co<sup>r</sup>te also the Wardens of the Yeomanry brought in
their accompte before the saide masters and yt was agreed upon good considerac͠ons for
that manye of the said yeomanrye did ympoverishe them selves by makinge of qr̃ter

quarter Dyners be kept in o<sup>r</sup> Hall by the saide yeomanrye or any of them but shall
do as heretofore hathe ben accustomed to be don.</p></div>

<p>1587. The Yeomanry seem to have again incurred the displeasure
of the Masters, who thereupon summoned them to appear
and shew cause why their grant should not be annulled, whereupon
they came on the 27th July <span class="nowrap">and&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">gave their ffree and full consentꝭ that yf they have broken any pt̃e of their

he should geve them. And yt was agreed by the saide Corte That the Masters or
Governo<sup>rs</sup> may take the pˀsentment of them but not swere them. And further yf the
yeomanry do request to be sworne they must be answered w<sup>th</sup> the wordꝭ of their pattent
w<sup>ch</sup> ys onlie to pˀsent them. And further touching the collecc͠on of their quartridge yt
must stand as yt dothe untill further consultac͠on be had therein and yf they have any
request to make or ought to saie they must bring the same in writinge into this Corte.</p>

<p>29th May, 1600. This daie the wardens of the yomanrye made requeste to
the Maisters that they woulde be pleased to redeliver unto them their booke of orders
which remayneth in their Custodie, whereuppon it is not thoughte fitt by the Courte
that the yeomanrie have the Custodie of the said booke, but that the Clarke of this
Companye keepe the same And that he shewe the same booke to the yeomanrye when
they have occasion to use it.</p></div>

<p>About two years previously the Court had endeavoured to
put down the Yeomanry and had curtailed many of their privileges;
the exact nature of the disagreement is not stated, but it doubtless
arose from the Yeomanry “takeinge to much uppon themsyllfs.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>17th January, 1604. At this Courte it is ordered That the Ould Wardens of
the Yomanrye doe bringe in such money as is behind by theire Audite beinge eight
pounds twelve shillings and eight pence <span class="smcap">Orells</span> to be committed to the Compter.</p></div>

<p>28th February, 1605. It was ordered that a Yeomanry of this
Company should be established, though there is no entry of its
extinguishment. Rules and ordinances were to be made by the
Court, and twenty-four persons were to be nominated by the “present
wardens of the said Yeomanry” to serve as a Court of Assistants
for the Yeomanry, with a power of veto reserved to the Masters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="286"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></span></p>

<h2>THE CLERK.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t.jpg" width="90" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">The</span> office of Clerk of the Company is doubtless as
ancient as the Company itself, although there is no
mention of one prior to the year <span class="nowrap">1530<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span>; but as there
were always registers to be kept, fees to receive,
apprentices to bind, and the multifarious business of a
Livery Guild to conduct and record, we conclude that
the office has existed from the earliest period.</p>

<p>The Clerk in Queen Mary’s time seems to have combined
the occupation of gardener with that of his office, and for this he
had but a small fee in addition to his stipend. Later on the Clerks
appear to have devised fees for every conceivable kind of business
which could possibly be transacted at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, and
in the 17th and 18th centuries the income derived from this source
alone must have been very considerable.</p>

<p>The Company has been served by good, bad and indifferent
Clerks; we prefer to dwell only on the former and record the names<span class="pagenum" title="289"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></span>
among others, of Francis Rowdon, Charles Bernard and John
Paterson as being worthy to be held in goodly remembrance. The
books of the Company abound in testimony to their ability as well
as to the fidelity and zeal which they displayed in the execution
of their office.</p>

<p>1st October, 1555. The first Clerk of whom there is any
record is Thomas Apulton (or Apleton), who, being Beadle, was
promoted to that office.</p>

<p>As will be seen elsewhere, the Company had a fair garden
in Monkwell Street, and the following interesting minute connects
it with the <span class="nowrap">Clerk:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">8th October, 1555. The Clercke of our Companye shall have for waxe pennes
and ynke and for trymynge of the gardeyn yerelye vj<sup>s</sup> viij<sup>d.</sup> Yf the gardeyn be not
well trymmed and made clene weded and swept at all tymes when the M<sup>r</sup> and Governors
of the clothing or any of Thassistaunce of the same shall see yt and thereupon fynde
faulte then the saide Clercke shall paye a ffyne to the hall because the said gardein
ys not made cleane swept and wedyd as the M<sup>r</sup> and Governors of the Clothinge and
thassistaunce of the same shall think meete and convenyent.</p></div>

<p>5th March, 1556. It was ordered that <span class="nowrap">if&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">The Clercke of the Company doo evile mysuse any of the Clothinge or of the
yomanry w<sup>th</sup> unsemely words &amp; dewe proofe therof had and proved he shalbe dismyssed
clere from the having of the Office of clercke.</p></div>

<p>27th August, 1557. John Johnson was elected and sworn Clerk
“for so longe time as he shal behave hymsyllfe well and honestlye in
the saide office.” The salary was fixed at £4 per annum, with 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
extra for paper, ink and keeping the garden, and “for wasshinge of the
lynen of the howse iij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d.</sup>”</p>

<p>It would appear that one Wilson had some time previously been
Clerk, for arrangements were made by which Wilson’s widow was not<span class="pagenum" title="290"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a></span>
to be put out of her house, and it was also settled that if Johnson died
before his wife, his widow should in like manner have the house after
his decease. The rent of this house, which was attached to the Hall
was 10<i>s.</i> per annum, and paid by the Clerk to the Renter Warden.</p>

<p>Johnson probably continued Clerk till about 1570, as the books
are kept in the same handwriting until then.</p>

<p>Thomas Garter succeeded Johnson, but on 14th January, 1572,
he was dismissed from his office for a “certain lewde facte by him
committed,” and William Field was elected and sworn in in his
place. Field wrote an exceedingly neat and precise hand.</p>

<p>20th March, 1572. It was ordered that in future the Clerk of
the Company should always be chosen from among the freemen.</p>

<p>15th March, 1575. William Eden elected Clerk vice Field.</p>

<p>14th November, 1577. Eden was ordered to receive £6 per
annum “benevolence” over and above his salary of £4, in consideration
of the “smalenes of his lyvinge.”</p>

<p>10th December, 1596. Eden was indebted to the Company
£10, “yet in regard of the hardnes of the tyme and his greate charge
he shalbe forborne this yere.” At the same Court, gifts were made to
the Beadle and Porter on account of the hardness of the times.</p>

<p>16th June, 1597. Eden’s troubles had not forsaken him for we
read under this <span class="nowrap">date&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">There was geven unto Willm̃ Eden Clark of the Companie in regard of his
greate charge and the scarsytie of the tyme the some of v<sup>li</sup> and for the x<sup>li</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> he oweth he
ys to pay the same as god shall inable him.</p></div>

<p>2nd November, 1597. Francis Rowdon elected Clerk vice
Eden. Rowdon appears to have been a most methodical man and<span class="pagenum" title="291"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></span>
kept the books with scrupulous neatness and care; his writing is a
very fine specimen of the Court hand of the period, and the best in the
Company’s books for many years.</p>

<p>1599. The Clerk’s Salary was raised to £6 per annum.</p>

<p>1600. To £8 per annum, and in</p>

<p>1603 To £10 per annum.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">26th November, 1607. This daye ffrancꝭ Rowdon Clark to this Company

<p class="mt-05em">6th July, 1609. Uppon the humble suite &amp; petic͠on of ffrancꝭ Rowdon Clarke
to this Company It is this daye ordered by this Courte that w<sup>th</sup>in one moneth next
ensuinge hee shall noĩat to the pˀnt M<sup>rs</sup> a sufficient Clarke to whom hee is desyreous to
surrender his place and office of Clark to this Company And his suite shalbe graunted
unto him if such pˀson so to be pˀnted unto this Court shalbe lyked and allowed.</p>
</div>

<p>26th July, 1609. Rowdon presented Richard Ratsdale,
Scrivener, for the office of Clerk, about whose sufficiency and ability
enquiries were ordered to be made, but they were not satisfactory, for,
on the 10th August, William Syddon was elected Clerk vice Rowdon.</p>

<p>The same day it was ordered that Rowdon was to continue
in the Livery and to have the use of the Hall and his house until
Michaelmas, also that Syddon was to be translated from the Cutlers’
Company.</p>

<p>Syddon’s records of the Company’s business were very meagre
and a great contrast to those of the former Clerk.</p>

<p>7th October, 1625. Syddon surrendered his clerkship to
Richard Turner (a son of Cressens Turner, Clerk in the Lord Mayor’s
Court), who was admitted and sworn. Turner died in 1643, and by
his will left some property to the Company to be annually distributed
in charity amongst freemen of the Barber-Surgeons, and this became
the source of a protracted litigation between his widow and the
Company. On the 17th November, 1643, she filed a bill against the
Company, which they defended, and succeeded in retaining the greater
portion of the bequest. The accounts appear to have been very
intricate and involved, remaining unsettled for many years. The<span class="pagenum" title="293"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a></span>
Court, however, distributed the whole of the bequest in accordance
with the will, as long as the estate (which was leasehold) held out.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>16th June, 1628. It is ordered by this Court and our M<sup>r</sup> gave order to the
Clarke that he should henceforward have a stoole and sitt at the end of the table w<sup>th</sup>
his bookes and register as the clarkes of other Companies doe.</p></div>

<p>2nd October, 1643. Robert Rawlins elected Clerk vice Turner.</p>

<p>30th June, 1648. The Court granted Rawlins £30 in consideration
of his great pains about the Company’s business, and ordered that
his salary should be raised from £10 to £30 per annum.</p>

<p>23rd February, 1658. Richard Reynell elected Clerk vice
Rawlins (resigned).</p>

<p>21st July, 1685. Joseph Masters elected Clerk.</p>

<p>17th September, 1685. Charles Hargrave elected “Deputy
Clerk.” The business of the Company had of late years increased
enormously in consequence of the examinations of and Certificates to
Navy Surgeons, examinations held for superannuation of wounded or
infirm soldiers and sailors, and other matters connected with the Navy
office, all of which entailed vast labour on the Clerk.</p>

<p>28th November, 1688. Charles Hargrave elected Clerk vice
Masters.</p>

<p>20th November, 1707. Charles Bernard elected Clerk vice
Hargrave.</p>

<p>Hargrave had kept the books in a slovenly manner, and appears
to have been both a dishonest servant as well as an improvident man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="294"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></span></p>

<p>11th December, 1707. It was reported to the Court that
Hargrave’s Estate was indebted to the Company £320 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, moneys
which he had received and not accounted for.</p>

<p>8th July, 1708. Mrs. Sarah Hargrave (his Widow) presented
a petition for relief, stating that she was in poor circumstances, with six
children unprovided for, whereupon the Court, notwithstanding her late
husband’s delinquencies, very generously ordered her a gratuity of
£12 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Charles Bernard was a relative of, and Executor to Charles
Bernard, Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen Anne and Master in 1703. It is
delightful to observe the methodical and careful manner in which
Bernard began, and all through his life kept the books and accounts;
he wrote a large and elegant hand, though somewhat encumbered with
flourishes, and his signature is a characteristic one.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 290px; margin-top: -1em;">
<img src="images/img043.jpg" width="290" height="134" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="fl0">7th September, 1708. Hargrave’s son was in the Compter,
and the Clerk was directed to see and talk with him about the
Company’s papers in his custody, and if he would give them up the
Clerk was to make him a present of three guineas.</p>

<p>The Court frequently relieved Mrs. Hargrave, and in December,
1709, gave her £15.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="295"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a></span></p>

<p>Among the official list of Clerk’s fees at this period were
the <span class="nowrap">following:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="mt-08em" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt1em">17th July, 1718. The Court as a particular reward to Charles Bernard their
Clerk for abstracting and peruseing the Company’s title to the Estate in East Smithfield
and for his care in passing the fine thereof whereby the Company saved a sume of money
and for his extraordinary trouble in attending the Lords of the Admiralty and prosecuteing
several persons for takeing the dead bodys from the place of Execuc͠on Did and do
hereby give him the sum̄e of fourscore pounds who accepted the same as a most
bountifull Instance of the kindness of this Court to him with a full resoluc͠on on his part
to acquitt himself by all imaginable and constant returns of duty and gratitude.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Charles Bernard, who had been a most zealous Clerk
and high in the esteem of the Court, died somewhere between the
5th and 20th February, 1740.</p>

<p>25th March, 1740. Joseph Wheeler, son of John Wheeler,
Barber-Surgeon, elected Clerk, vice Bernard. Wheeler wrote a
fine bold and flowing hand; and the books were well kept, but he
was evidently not so able a man as Mr. Bernard.</p>

<p>4th July, 1740. Joseph Wheeler provided two sureties who
entered into a bond for £3,000, to ensure his fidelity in the execution
of his office.</p>

<p>17th January, 1743. The Commissioners of the Navy having
complained that sufficient regard had not been paid to former letters
of theirs respecting Surgeons’ Mates, and it appearing that the Clerk
had withheld the said letters from the Court, it was ordered that he
should be suspended forthwith, with which the Commissioners were
acquainted and also that the Court had resolved not to take off such
suspension but by the consent and desire of the Commissioners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="296"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></span></p>

<p>31st January, 1743. The Commissioners of the Navy having
signified their desire that the Clerk should be restored to his office,
he was called into Court, severely reprimanded, reinstated in his
position, and cautioned as to his future conduct.</p>

<p>Mr. Wheeler continued Clerk until the separation of the
Surgeons from the Barbers in 1745, when neither body retained
his services, and it appearing that moneys were due from him to
the Company, application was made to his sureties.</p>

<p>25th June, 1745. John Paterson was chosen Clerk to the
Barbers’ Company at the first Court held after the separation, and
entered into a Bond with two sureties in a sum of £2,000.</p>

<p>19th February, 1746. Mr. Paterson having brought in an
account of his Costs in the matter of the separation of the Surgeons
amounting to £167 13<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, and also an account of voluntary contributions
by members of the Company towards defraying the same
amounting to £168 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, he begged the Court to accept of his
past services as a return for the honour done him in his election,
and the Court were pleased to accept of the compliment, but having
a high sense of the services rendered by Mr. Paterson, they directed
the sum of £80 to be laid out in plate and presented to him “to
remain in his family as a memorial of his merit and of their gratitude.”</p>

<p>5th March, 1765. Mr. Paterson requested permission to resign
his office, which the Court accepted with great reluctance, and passed
a complimentary resolution in his favour.</p>

<p>Richard Beale, who had been Mr. Paterson’s clerk and was
highly recommended by him, was elected Clerk.</p>

<p>8th August, 1765. Mr. Paterson was unanimously elected
an Assistant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="297"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Beale bequeathed £500 to the Company in reversion on
the death of Mrs. Ann Woodhouse.</p>

<p>22nd April, 1766. James Marye elected Clerk vice Beale
(deceased).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>22nd April, 1766. John Paterson Esquire being withdrawn a Motion was made
and the question being put That a piece of plate of the value of Fifty Pounds or thereabouts
be presented to the said M<sup>r</sup> Paterson as a mark of the high esteem and value this
Court entertains of his merit and abilities and to shew their gratitude to him for his long
and faithful services during the course of twenty years and in return for his readiness
on every occasion to assist this Court with his advice and council, the same was carried
in the Affirmative, <span class="smcap">Nemine Contradicente</span>.</p></div>

<p>By the Accounts for this year it appears that a Silver Tureen,
Dish and Ladle were purchased for £65 16<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, and this was no
doubt the gift to Mr. Paterson.</p>

<p>20th August, 1767. The Court being informed that Mr.
Paterson intended to stand for the City at the next General
Election, it was ordered that he should have the use of the
Company’s Hall for his meetings.</p>

<p>An excellent mezzotint portrait of Mr. Paterson, with some
eulogistic lines below, is preserved at Barbers’ Hall.</p>

<p>In 1754 Mr. Paterson presented to the Company the valuable
portrait of the Duchess of Richmond, painted by Sir Peter Lely,
and which still adorns the Court Room.</p>

<p>Mr. Paterson was a member of the Common Council, and
sometime Chairman of the Bridge House Estates Committee, he
was also M.P. for Ludgershall, Wilts. He was ever faithful to this
Company, serving it with distinguished ability, and seems to have
been greatly respected and esteemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="298"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></span></p>

<p>1st June, 1790. William Wood elected Clerk vice Marye.</p>

<p>Mr. Wood presented the Company with a handsome Silver
Tea Urn.</p>

<p>13th August, 1795. Edward Grose Smith (Mr. Wood’s partner)
elected Clerk vice Wood, resigned.</p>

<h2>THE BEADLE.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t.jpg" width="90" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">There</span> is no certainty as to the first institution of
this office, though it is probably not so old as
that of the Clerk, who in ancient times, summoned
the Livery, collected the quarterage and performed
various duties which we afterwards find assigned to
the Beadle, and we may conclude that in those days
he was little more than a Caretaker or “Porter”; indeed, this is the
more likely as the latter designation is frequently applied to the Under
Beadle in the Records.</p>

<p>As the business and numbers of the Company increased,
several minor functions of the Clerk were delegated to the Porter
or Beadle, who had distinctive duties assigned to him varying with
the age in which he lived; among these may be enumerated, sweeping
the garden, collecting quarterage, cleaning the Hall, whipping naughty
apprentices, summoning freemen, etc., bringing home dead bodies
from Tyburn, keeping lists of journeymen, pressing Surgeons and
Barbers for sea service, assisting the Masters on search days,
hunting up and laying informations against non freemen practising<span class="pagenum" title="300"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></span>
Barbery and Surgery, marshalling and heading processions, both
at the Hall and in the City pageants, guarding the Parlour
door, and other offices too numerous to particularise, though
there were but few of them which did not yield a fee, and
indeed our Beadle could hardly have lived without fees, for
his official salary in Edward VI’s time was but £4 per annum,
which, notwithstanding the greater value of money then, could
scarcely be considered a fat living.</p>

<p>With one exception, the office has been (and properly so) held
by freemen, and in the appointment of the Court. In 1626, however,
the Lord Keeper sent a letter “recommending” (<i>i.e.</i>, commanding)
the Company to elect one Gorton, a servant of his, to the place,
and Gorton was accordingly chosen. The interference of the
King and his great officers in the patronage and appointments
vested in the City guilds was carried to great lengths with some
of the Companies, and there are amusing accounts extant of the
astuteness with which this meddling was sometimes met (<i>vide</i>
Herbert’s Livery Companies). Our Company, with the solitary
exception above referred to, appears to have been happily free from
this species of intervention.</p>

<p>Early in the 17th century there were two Beadles of the
Clothing, the Under Beadle being often styled the Porter, but
about the middle of the 18th century, and since then, one
Beadle has sufficed.</p>

<p>The Beadle has always had his “house” at the Hall,
and used formerly to pay a small quit rent for it. On the
dismission of a Beadle for misconduct, a difficulty was sometimes
experienced in regaining possession of this house, and<span class="pagenum" title="301"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a></span>
various shifts were resorted to; even the Beadles’ Widows now
and then refused to turn out, and the “benevolences” meted
out to them were possibly sometimes in the nature of bribes
to induce them to go.</p>

<p>Besides the Beadles of the Clothing, there was a Beadle of the
Yeomanry, whose duties were analogous to those of his more exalted
brethren, and into whose office he frequently stepped when there was a
vacancy.</p>

<p>The Beadles for many years had a most disagreeable duty to
perform, namely, the procuring and bringing home from Tyburn the
dead bodies of malefactors. By the Act 32 Hen. VIII, the Company
were empowered to have yearly the bodies of four executed felons for
“anatomies,” and the practice was for the Beadles to attend at the
gallows and select such bodies as they pleased. Their opponents were
generally the hangman, who himself trafficked in these uncanny goods,
the relatives of the criminal, and the populace who were incited by the
relatives to resist the Beadles. Many were the unseemly fights which
took place over these bodies, and oftentimes when the Beadles had
secured a “subject” and were driving off with it in a coach, they were
attacked and beaten, and the body rescued from them. The hangman
appears to have been entitled to the dead man’s clothes, for on more
than one occasion the Company gave him compensation for them, they
having been torn to pieces in the brutal struggle for possession.
Moreover the Company had often to satisfy the Coachmen for
personal injuries and for damages to their coaches, as well as to give
special gratuities to their Beadles by way of solatium for the beatings
which they underwent. Frequent prosecutions and convictions followed
the interference with the Company’s Officers at these times, and even
the Sheriff’s Officers were on one occasion dismissed by the City for
having sided against the Beadles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="302"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a></span></p>

<p>The hangman came to the Hall regularly for his Christmas
Box and gave a receipt for the same, sometimes affixing the title
“Executioner” after his
signature. Many curious
particulars relating to the
above will be found elsewhere.

Accounts</a>, <a href="#SURGERY">Surgery</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>The Beadle is elected
annually by the Court,
and resides at the Hall.
The two Silver maces pertaining
to his office are as
handsome and massive as
any in the City and are
always carried before the
Master on Court days.</p>

<p>14th May, 1530. The
earliest reference to the
Beadle in our Records is to
be found in the Ordinances
signed by Sir Thomas
More, where it is directed
that the Members shall take their seniority “according to the trew
entrance therof in the Bedyllꝭ Rolle.”</p>

<p>6th November, 1550. Richard Wilson was Beadle at this time.</p>

<p>6th July, 1552. Thomas Appulton, Beadle, vice Wilson
deceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="303"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></span></p>

<p>19th September, 1552. It was agreed that Appulton “shall
have his messe of meate on the feaste dayes.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4th May, 1574. Here was the Wardens of the yeomanry and brought
Anthony Hall in to the Courte to be admytted Beadle of the yeomanrye and he was
sworne and admytted and fathe(r) Roger(s) put to his penc͠on and to geve attendaunce
but as he is able.</p></div>

<p>22nd July, 1577. Richard Rogers, the old Beadle of the
Yeomanry, was ordered a gift of 20<i>s.</i> and a yearly pension of 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>23rd July, 1582. Robert Norton, Yeomanry Beadle, was
authorised to take 2<i>d.</i> of every freeman on his admission, and his

dismissed.</p>

<p>14th June, 1621. Humphry Mumford elected Beadle.</p>

<p>3rd July, 1621. Chapman, the Porter, dismissed for using “lewd
speeches,” but on his humble submission and craving pardon on his
knees, he was reinstated, 10th July, 1621.</p>

<p>20th August, 1621. The Company could not get Clifton out of
his house, so they gave him 20<i>s.</i> and a pension of 40<i>s.</i> per annum
during good behaviour and the pleasure of the Court. Possibly the
“pleasure of the Court” did not extend beyond one year.</p>

<p>15th February, 1626. Edward Gorton (recommended by the
Lord Keeper) elected Beadle in place of Mumford.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>10th July, 1628. This daye this Court takeing notice of an order made the 3
of Julye, 1621, by w<sup>ch</sup> order Chapman our Porter for his dissolute and deboist carriage
was ip̃o facto then by that order dismissed of his said place and likewise of an order

was assigned a pension of £4 per annum during pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="305"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a></span></p>

<p>25th January, 1637. Edmond Johnson “who writeth very

deceased.</p>

<p>8th July, 1708. William Cave and Thomas Repton were
Beadles.</p>

<p>6th July, 1710. Repton’s widow had £3 given her to bury
her late husband.</p>

<p>20th February, 1711. Mr. Gratian Bale (son of Nathan Bale,
Citizen and Grocer) who was apprenticed 22nd June, 1669 to Robert
Andrewes (Surgeon), and afterwards became an Examiner in Surgery,
and Master in 1709, petitioned the Court to be relieved of the office
of an Assistant on the ground that he had fallen into decayed
circumstances and could not possibly support that dignity, and on<span class="pagenum" title="306"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a></span>
his resignation being accepted, the Court proceeded to the election
of a Beadle in the room of Thomas Repton deceased, whereupon
Mr. Bale was <span class="nowrap">elected&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">And in regard that the s<sup>d</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Bale had been Ma<sup>r</sup> of This Company This Court
doth hereby give him leave (asking the consent of the Governo<sup>rs</sup> for the time being) to

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">in order that the business may from thenceforward be discharged and dispatched
with propˀ vigour and dexterity and to the honour and profitt of the Company.</p></div>

<p>13th April, 1721. Watkins being so indisposed as not to be
able to perform his duties, Charles Window (who looked after the
dead bodies at Tyburn) was ordered to officiate for him. Watkins
shortly after lost his speech and got into Ludgate prison, where
he had a weekly allowance from the Company&mdash;he seems to have
remained in prison till his death, 3rd August, 1724.</p>

<p>1st October, 1566, is an entry of the translation from the
Woodmongers’ Company of William Slade, who was stated to be
“a Surgeon &amp; learned yt w<sup>th</sup> Ric. Venar &amp; John Hall at Maydstone.”
This John Hall was a famous Surgeon in his day and wrote “An
Historiall Expostulation Against the beastlye Abusers, bothe of
Chyrurgerie and Physyke,” which has been reprinted with several
valuable notes by the Percy Society (Vol. XI) accompanied with
John Hall’s portrait.</p>

<p>18th March, 1567. Thomas Wells, Merchant Taylor, complained
against Nicholas Wyborde for “not curynge his mans hed
y<sup>t</sup> he tooke in hande.”</p>

<p>The following order for the erection of raised seats for the
members attending the Anatomy lectures, and for a screen to
temporarily hide the body, indicates the growing interest taken by
the Company in the furtherance of technical education; and from
the reference to <i>the</i> skeleton, for which a case was directed to be
made, it is highly probable that this was the only specimen which
the Company in those days possessed!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1st February, 1568. Also yt ys ordayned and agreed by this Courte That there

</p></div>

<p>Surgeons were continually being called before the Court for
“evil dealing” with their patients, and for not performing cures for
which they had received the money beforehand. The Court generally
endeavoured to effect a friendly relationship between the parties,
though in cases which were considered as clearly proved against the
Surgeon, he was either fined or imprisoned, or else ordered to make
suitable compensation to the patient.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7th September, 1574. Here was John Griffen complayned uppon William

<p><span class="pagenum" title="320"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a></span></p>

<p>The following order was doubtless directed against a prevalent
mania for relics of notorious criminals.</p>

<p>17th July, 1578. That no pˀson or pˀsons of this Companie do presume at anie

<p>18th July, 1583. The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen
having recommended that persons using Barbery should not practise
Surgery, the Master and Governors went to Guildhall, and there
promised the Court of Aldermen that they would compel all their free
Barbers to enter into bonds not to “medle or deale w<sup>th</sup> any sick of the
plauge or infected cum morbo gallico,” and accordingly the Barbers
entered into bonds to that effect.</p>

<p>In Stow’s Annales, ed. 1592, p.&nbsp;1261, is the following remarkable
account of a “subject” coming to life again at our hall.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1587. The 20 of Februarie, a strange thing happened a man hanged for felonie
at Saint Thomas Wateringes, being begged by the Chirurgions of London, to have made
of him an Anatomie, after hee was dead to all mens thinking, cut downe, stripped of his
apparell, laide naked in a chest, throwne into a carre, and so brought from the place of
execution through the Borough of Southwarke over the bridge, and through the Citie of
London to the Chirurgions Hall nere unto Cripelgate: The chest being there opened, and
the weather extreeme cold hee was found to be alive, and lived till the three and twentie
of Februarie, and then died.</p></div>

<p>It was doubtless the above circumstance, to which reference is
made in the next minute; it would seem that the body had been
begged by some surgeons and taken to the hall to be dissected there,<span class="pagenum" title="321"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a></span>
it being unlawful to dissect elsewhere, and that on the resuscitation of
the unhappy man, the Company had been put to some expenses whereupon
they made an order to provide for any similar case in the future.
This body would be what is often referred to in the Books as a
“private anatomy,” in opposition to the four “public” bodies of felons
to which the Company were annually entitled.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>13th July, 1587. Iˀtm yt ys agreed That yf any bodie w<sup>ch</sup> shall at anie tyme

out, and a large army being collected in the North the
Barber-Surgeons were directed to “press” and forward twenty-three

<p class="mt1em">In accordance with their Charters the ancient practice of the
Company had been to elect annually two Surgeons and two Barbers
for Master and Wardens; this fell into electing two Surgeons and two
others who were often neither Barbers nor Surgeons, and latterly,
even the qualification of Surgery came to be disregarded, whereupon
(29th March, 1639) a mandate, signed by Charles I and directed to the
Company, was read in Court (see <a href="#APPENDIX_G">Appendix, G</a>) in which the King
set forth that divers persons as “hosiers dyers &amp; other tradesmen
unskilfull in Chirurgery or Barbarye” had been chosen for Masters
and Wardens contrary to the Charters and Acts of Parliament, and
further “wee takeing into considerac͠on of what dangerous consequence
it maye be to suffer a Companye wherein the lives and safetie of o<sup>r</sup>
people are soe much concerned and for w<sup>ch</sup> o<sup>r</sup> progenitors have soe
carefully provided to be governed by such unskilfull pˀsons,” the<span class="pagenum" title="340"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a></span>
King straitly commanded the Company to elect the Governors
in the future as they ought to do, viz.: two Barbers and two
Surgeons each year.</p>

<p>This order of the King appears for some little time to have
been obeyed, and then the Company relapsed into their old practice
of choosing at their pleasure, whereupon another mandate came from
the King, for we find <span class="nowrap">that:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="mt-05em">17th January, 1644. The Court took notice of the King’s
mandate, and a very long and elaborate minute is entered to the
effect that the practice of choosing two Barbers and two Surgeons for
Governors was fraught with much inconvenience and had led to great
dissensions, and the Court referring to the Statute of Henry VII,
where it is allowed that any person free of the Company following any
other profession than that of a Barber or Surgeon should be reputed
and taken as a Barber, ordered that for the future, any Member of
the Assistants, other than a Barber or Surgeon, might be put in
nomination, and that he should be accounted a Barber. The Court
were very careful to express their loyalty to the King whilst they
ignored his mandate, trusting no doubt, that should they afterwards
be called to account by the King, their dutiful expressions towards
him would serve in a measure as an excuse for disobeying his
express commands.</p>

several persons to practise as Surgeons without due examination, the
following memorial was ordered to be sent to his Grace.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pl7hi mb-02em"><span class="smcap">To</span> The most Reverend ffather in God Thomas by Divine Providence
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p class="pl7hi"><span class="smcap">The</span> humble petition of the Masters or Governo<sup>rs</sup> Assistants Livery &amp;
ffreemen of the Mystery &amp; Comonalty of Barbers &amp; Surgeons
of London.</p>

<p class="ti0em">
<span class="smcap">Sheweth:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> severall Surgeons unlearned &amp; unskilfull in that Art have set up &amp;
practised within Seven miles of the City of London under Colour of a Licence from
yo<sup>r</sup> Grace &amp; without the examination &amp; approbation of such Surgeons as the Law hath
appointed for that purpose ffor which reason wee beg leave to lay before yo<sup>r</sup> Grace the
following representation, viz<sup>t.</sup>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the Company of Barbers &amp; Surgeons were incorporated by the Charter of
King Edward the Second w<sup>ch</sup> was confirmed by the Charter of Edward the fourth with
this Addic͠onal Clause That the Governo<sup>rs</sup> of the Company should examine approve &amp;
authorise all such as should practise in that ffaculty<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the said Charter of Edward 4<sup>th</sup> not having provided by sufficient penaltys
against that great &amp; growing mischeife which sprung from the unskillfullness of several<span class="pagenum" title="347"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a></span>
vain pretenders in this art, It was provided by the Statute of the 3 H. 8, cap. 11 That
no person within London or seven miles of it should exercise Surgery except they were
first examined approved &amp; admitted by the Bishop of London or Dean of Paul’s calling
to him four expert persons in that faculty under forfeiture of five pounds pˀ month And
out of the City &amp; precints seven miles, unless exaĩed &amp; approved by the Bishop of the
Diocess or his Vicar Generall in like mañer, upon which Statute yo<sup>r</sup> petitioners beg leave
to observe That it was wholly introductive of a new law &amp; creates a power in the Bishop
that was before vested in the Company by the Charter, so doth it take care to confine
that power meerly to the Diocesan under the limitation of a regular examination in his
presence by four persons that had already passed their examinations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bishop of each Diocess being therefore by their Law invested with a
Temporall power perfectly forreign to their Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction &amp; Spirituall care
We do humbly hope yo<sup>r</sup> Grace will not exercise this authority which was never by this
law placed in the Metropolitane but was only to be exercised by the Diocesan under a
regular Examination by persons admitted into our Company. And yo<sup>r</sup> Grace will find
this the more reasonable upon Consideration of this Act for the law makes it a part of
the Ecclesiasticall concernment upon a supposition that severall persons pretending to
Surgery had practised Sorcery &amp; Witchcraft which yo<sup>r</sup> Grace will pardon us if we beg
leave to say was an artificiall notion set up by the popish Clergy in those times to draw
within their own Verge the Inspection &amp; approbation of all such persons as attended
the beds of dying men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> however that law was obtained, our Company which consisted of all such
persons as exercised Surgery within London or seven miles being afterwards incorporated
by the Statute of 32 H. 8, C. 42, no man could practise within London or seven Miles
Compass of the City without an examination by four of the faculty thus incorporated &amp;
without being solemnly admitted into the Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> accordingly the Bishop of London has from time to time been pleased to
do us that Justice that we humbly presume yo<sup>r</sup> Grace will not deny us, viz<sup>t</sup> not to license
any person within his Diocess who hath not first obtained a Testimoniall under the
Seale of our Company certifying the examination of such person &amp; his skill &amp; ability
for the exercise of that art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> if this restraint of yo<sup>r</sup> Graces Licences were not to be asked as a matter of
Justice We should not doubt to obtain it as a favour, when yo<sup>r</sup> Grace considers how this
maner of entring into the faculty opens a way to the Ignorant &amp; unskillfull to the great
prejudice both of the Company &amp; of the publick, for yo<sup>r</sup> Grace cannot be so much
at leisure from yo<sup>r</sup> pastorall care to enquire into the abilitys of such as pretend to sign<span class="pagenum" title="348"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a></span>
their Testimonialls nor is any person that comes in by this method subject to the
regulation of our Company’s By-Laws which are all signed under the hands of the two
Cheife Justices &amp; the present Lord Chancellour &amp; contrived with the greatest exactness
to regulate the practise of this art, besides that every person admitted is obliged to
give bond to the Company that he will diligently attend such cures as he shall be called
unto &amp; that he will never wilfully administer any hurtfull medecine, And in all cases
of danger call in one of our ten Examiners to his assistance who are always ready to
afford their assistance when asked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lastly</span> we think we may add that the Companys services of the publick may
reasonably deserve some consideration from all lovers of the publick for that ten of the
principall persons of the faculty meet once a week at their Hall to examine &amp; approve all
Surgeons &amp; Surgeons Mates that are in her Majesties Service which amount to five
hundred in a year &amp; to inspect all Sea Surgeons Chests of medicines &amp; instruments &amp; to
peruse the Journalls of their practice &amp; to view all Sea officers who are wounded in fight
&amp; this without the least reward nor are any admitted into the Sea Service without their
Testimoniall &amp; approbation to the very great preservation of the Seamen And tis
presumed that a Regulation that has been found so necessary at Sea will appear at Land
to be equally beneficiall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wherefore</span> yo<sup>r</sup> petitioners humbly begg that yo<sup>r</sup> Grace will not for the future
be pleased to give Lycences to any persons to practise Surgery within London or
seven miles compass thereof untill such persons skill &amp; ability for the exercise of that art
appears by a Testimoniall under our Companys Seale to have been tried &amp; approved
of by the ten Examiners of our Company appointed for that purpose.</p></div>

<p>There is no note of any reply to this letter having been
received from the Archbishop.</p>

<p>6th February, 1711. The Court petitioned the Queen that
they might have the Examination and certifying of all Army Surgeons

that they examined and passed the Navy Surgeons.</p>

<p>20th February, 1711. Letters similar in effect to the one
addressed to the Archbishop on 1st June, 1710, though slightly

that sum he at once paid down.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>9th October, 1711. Richard Russell one of the persons who stands Indicted
for carrying away the last publick body applying himself to this Court &amp; offering to be

himself to Her Majesty’s Attorney Generall for a Noli pˀsequi as to the said Russell in
order to make him an evidence upon the s<sup>d</sup> Indictment &amp; particularly ag<sup>st</sup> one Samuell
Waters whom the Court did likewise order to be indicted for the said fact.</p></div>

<p>It was no uncommon circumstance for candidates under
examination to be rejected, the reason being often rather tersely
given, <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">13th February, 1712. W<sup>m</sup> Ogilby Rejected &amp; said very Saucily it should be the

<p>27th May, 1712. John Wooding having been convicted at the
Old Bailey for taking away the body of John Addison from the place
of execution, the Court prayed the Lord Chief Justice to allow the
sentence upon him to be inserted in the Gazette, and afterwards to
consent in the Company’s name to the remission of his fine and
imprisonment.</p>

<p>19th June, 1712. Mr. Bartlett, a truss maker, having been
summoned for practising Surgery, he was ordered “to take from his
sign board that he cures Ruptures.”</p>

<p>7th May, 1713. The Court having complained to the Bishop
of London of the inconvenience arising from his licensing persons to
practise Surgery, and the Bishop having informed the Company that
he would not issue any more such licenses without a certificate of
fitness from the Company, it was thereupon ordered that 5 guineas
should be paid yearly to his Lordship’s Registrar as Caveat money.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

unskillfull &amp; wilfull practice &amp; to be sued upon the by law or his bond as shall be
thought most convenient.</p>

<p>19th November, 1714. Att this Court John Spurling a Barber at Highgate was
ordered to be prosecuted upon the Company’s Charter for practising Surgery upon
John Holmes Barber.</p></div>

<p>21st April, 1715. The Court being informed that the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty proposed to place the viewing of Sea
Surgeons’ chests with Dr. Oliver and Mr. Rider, Physician and<span class="pagenum" title="351"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a></span>
Surgeon of Greenwich Hospital, to the exclusion of the Company’s
rights and contrary to the Charter of Charles I; it was ordered that
a memorial should be presented to the first Lord against such a
proposal.</p>

<p>4th June, 1715. The Lords of the Admiralty having requested
the Court to undertake, with Dr. Oliver, the examination of such
Warrant Officers in the Navy as should apply for superannuation
pensions on the ground of age, wounds or infirmities, the Court
directed the Clerk to reply stating that the Company would perform
that office, and hold Courts for the purpose, on the first Friday in each
month. Pursuant to the above, Courts were held and certificates
granted from time to time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5th June, 1716. It is ordered That Nathaniel Charles be prosecuted He

Company’s Registers of ffremen and apprentices and The Table of Governors Names to
enable him to publish his book now in hand relateing to the lives and writings of eminent
Surgeons.</p>

<p>6th July, 1716. Att this Court M<sup>r</sup> Langley who lives in Shoreditch being
suspected to be a Quack Doctor was exaĩed touching his skill in Surgery but not being
able to answer a question was rejected.</p>

<p>1st July, 1720. Ordered That the Porter in Southwark and a Bone setter in

qualifyed he was rejected and ordered his money back And ordered to be prosecuted in
case he shall ever practice Surgery for the future.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="352"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a></span></p>

<p>23rd June, 1721. The Master represented to the Court that
“great trouble and inconveniency” had arisen in consequence of such
Surgeons as had of late offered themselves for examination not having
presented the Governors and Examiners “with Gloves of such sort
and goodness as had been customarily and antiently given to the
Governors and Examiners upon such examinac͠on and by buying the
gloves of tradesemen who were not proper dealers in such sort of
goods.” Whereupon it was ordered that in future every Candidate
before Examination should deposit with the Clerk as much money as
would be sufficient to pay each of the Governors and Examiners who
should be present six shillings, for them to lay out in the purchase of
such gloves as they should see fit. On the 10th December, 1725, the
glove money was raised from 6<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The real secret of the above order, no doubt was, that there
were such a great number of surgeons coming up for examination from
time to time, that the Governors and Examiners got less money and
more gloves than they wanted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>26th April, 1723. It is ordered that M<sup>r</sup> John Douglass Surgeon and a fforeigne
brother of this Company shall be admitted into the freedom and Livery of this Company

<p>2nd October, 1724. At this Court Thomas Cooke was examined for a fforreigne
Brother But being found insufficient he was rejected. Note he lives in Duck Lane
Publishes Bills as a Quack pretending to the cure of the Venereall disease, but he being<span class="pagenum" title="353"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a></span>
examined touching the cure of that distemper in particular and being found to know little
or nothing of it, the Court directed him to take down his Surgeon’s sign and not to
practice for the future on pain of being sued upon the Act of Parliament and Company’s
Charter.</p></div>

<p class="mt1em">14th October, 1726. At this Court Peter North Boatswain of His Majesty’s
ship Cornwall was viewed for superannuation and pretended to be afflicted with deafness
&amp; the Gout. But the Court being of opinion that his deafness (if any) was occasion<sup>d</sup> by
wax in his ear only, which might be cured by syringing, and not being satisfy<sup>d</sup> that he had
the gout, The Court did not think fit but that he was capable of further service at Sea.</p>

<p>At this Court one Chambers surgeon in Duck Lane was examined touching his
Skill in Surgery in order to be made a fforeign brother, but appearing to be a stupid
ffellow &amp; a sort of a Quack who gave out Bills, and not being able to answer a question
the Court rejected him.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="354"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a></span></p>

<p>17th February, 1727. The Navy Board having, on the 16th
inst., written to the Master and Wardens enclosing a copy of an
anonymous letter which had been received, charging the Examiners
in Surgery with partiality, and with qualifying incompetent persons as
Navy Surgeons, the Court seem to have taken the matter up in a high
spirited manner, and returned a long letter setting forth their practice
in conducting the Examinations, referring in detail to the particular
case alleged against them, and indeed made a most excellent and
satisfactory defence. The correspondence is very lengthy and full of
detail, much reference being made to the work carried on by the
Company for the public service without fee or reward.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7th March, 1727. It is ordered That for y<sup>e</sup> future when any apprentices are to
be bound to Surgeons they shall be called in &amp; be examined by themselves touching
their skil in y<sup>e</sup> Latin tongue.</p>

<p>7th April, 1727. James Ripoult a Frenchman was called in but not speaking
English nor being naturalized the Court did not think it proper to examine him.</p>

<p>5th October, 1727. John Jacob Sax being a Prussian by birth &amp; not naturalized
nor understanding English The Court did not think it proper to examine him.</p>

<p>William Miles recomended by Lord Torrington &amp; examined but seeming to
know nothing of Surgery was rejected.</p></div>

<p>16th January, 1729. A Petition was drawn up by the Court
for presentation to the King, setting forth the Company’s right to four
dead bodies of felons yearly to be obtained at Tyburn, and that of
late divers riotous persons had wrested the bodies from the Company’s
Beadles at the place of execution. The Court declared that these
proceedings were greatly to the detriment of the study of Surgery,
and also set forth the services which the Company rendered to the
State, by examining Surgeons and their Mates for the Royal Navy,
viewing their medicine chests and instruments, viewing all such<span class="pagenum" title="355"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a></span>
officers as are wounded in fight at Sea and for superannuation,
and they <span class="nowrap">conclude&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">Your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that your Majesty will be graciously

yearly as are granted unto your Petic͠oners by the said Act of Parliament or otherwise to
releive your Petic͠oners in such manner as your Majesty in your Majesty’s most gracious
wisdom and condescension shall think fitt.</p></div>

<p>The Company seem also to have applied to the Court of
Aldermen again for assistance in this matter, for, on the 7th March
following, it was ordered that 2,000 copies of two orders of the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen, dated respectively 4th February and 4th
March, should be printed, and copies fixed up at Newgate and other
public places on the road to Tyburn, some time before any execution,
and also that the said orders should be inserted in the London Gazette
and other papers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4th April, 1729. Peregrine Compton Rejected being fuddled &amp; not answering
a question.</p></div>

<p>1st February, 1732. It was ordered that any extraordinary
cases of Surgery appearing in the journals of the Sea Surgeons should
be copied out into a book, as well as any others which might be
reported to the Governors, and the same be laid before the Court of
Examiners, from time to time, for their direction as to whether the
same should be published. This book, if it ever existed, is not now
in the Company’s possession.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>15th August, 1734. It is ordered that from henceforward a Silver Medal not
exceeding the value of a Guinea with a proper device upon each side of it to be made
and presented at the end of the year to each of the Demonstrators now chosen and
to the Demonstrators for the time being as an acknowledgment for their trouble in
performing such Demonstrations.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="356"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a></span></p>

<p>These medals by a subsequent order, were to have a representation
of Holbein’s picture on one side and of Inigo Jones’ Theatre on
the other, but they do not appear to have ever been struck.</p>

<p>It was customary at the Demonstrations of Anatomy to provide
specimens of parts of animals, presumably for comparison, as appears
by some of the expenses incurred, <i>e.g.</i>, in <span class="nowrap">1732:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="mt1em">4th February, 1735. Under this date is an entry of a long
letter from the Commissioners of the Navy, complaining of the want
of skill in a Surgeon, whereby great mortality had ensued on the ship
<i>Newcastle</i>; the Court examined the Surgeon and his Journal and
considered that there was nothing to find fault with as regarded his
proficiency in Surgery, and that the sickness among the ship’s crew
required skill in Physic rather than in Surgery, moreover they declared
that the Physician at Greenwich examined the Navy Surgeons as to<span class="pagenum" title="357"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a></span>
their skill in Physic and not the Barber-Surgeons’ Company. The
Clerk was directed to write to the Commissioners to this effect, and
to state that the Company did not consider themselves answerable
for any man’s want of skill in Physic.</p>

<p>A long letter dated 5th February was accordingly written
and is set out in the Minute Book. The Surgeon complained of
was Thomas Middleton, son of Mr. Henry Middleton (the oldest
Member of the Court) and it appears that he had been fully
examined and qualified.</p>

<p>29th September, 1735. The following order touching the

<p>1st June, 1736. It is ordered that the Constables of the Holborn Division shall
be allowed Three Guineas and a halfe above the Guinea already paid them in regard to
their expences at the last execution, when the Body was taken from the Beadles and
retaken by the Constables and the Clerk is ordered to repay the same But the Clerk is
not to pay the officers of the Compter the Two guineas usually received by them at
every execution.</p>

<p>24th September, 1741. John Thrift the Executioner this day attended on a
complaint made against him by the Beadles for obstructing the Bodys being brought
from Tyburne to the Hall for dissection and threatning to prevent the Company’s
measures for obtaining the same, when after he had been reproved, was Dismissed,
But the Court then agreed (in order to prevent his intended proceedings) to
attend the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen that they may on complaint made
be releived therein.</p>

<p>18th December, 1741. Ordered that the High Constable of Holburne be
allowed Ten shillings and sixpence as his ffee for every Body that shall be brought from
Tyburne and delivered at this Company’s Hall and for his aiding and assisting the
Company’s Beadles therein and not otherwise.</p></div>

<p>10th February, 1742. The Court either forgetting or ignoring
their order of 7th May, 1713, now ordered that Mr. William Skelton,
a proctor in Doctors’ Commons, who had for many years past received
five guineas annually as Caveat money (being Registrar of the Bishop
of London) and “pretended to be allowed him by this Company on
account of his Lordship’s Grant for the Prohibiting of Surgeons to
practice within his Diocese be no longer entitled to such fee untill
such time as this Court shall be better informed of the nature of his
right of demanding the same.”</p>

<p>23rd November, 1740. Great consternation prevailed at the
Hall in consequence of a malefactor who had been hung at Tyburn
having revived when brought here for dissection. The account of<span class="pagenum" title="359"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a></span>
this remarkable occurrence is recorded by the Clerk, Mr. Joseph
Wheeler, on the last page of the rough Minute Book 1738–1742, and
is very interesting. From the record of his trial at the Old Bailey
(see Sessions Papers) Duell appears to have been an outrageous young
scoundrel. A popular impression prevails, and frequent currency has
been given to it, that Duell subsequently made a fortune abroad and
out of gratitude to the Barber-Surgeons for saving his life, presented
them with the handsome leather folding screen now in the Court
Room, the best answer to which is, that the screen in question is
referred to in the Company’s Inventory some thirty years previously to
Mr. Duell’s visit to Tyburn.</p>

<p>Mr. Wheeler’s account is as <span class="nowrap">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ml6em">
November the 23<sup>d.</sup> 1740.
</p>

<p>This day W<sup>m.</sup> Duell (who had been indicted at the Old Bayley for a Rape and
had received sentence of Death for the same) was carryed to Tyburne in order to be
executed where having hung some time was cutt down and brought to this Company’s
Hall in order to be dissected where he had not been five minutes before Life appeared in
him &amp; being let blood and other means used for his recovery in less than two hours he
sat upright drank some warm wine and lookˀd often round him and before he was carryed
back to Newgate which was about Twelve o’the Clock at Night he severall times
pronounced distinctly the word <span class="smcap">Dont</span> when anybody touched him though was thought to
be mostly insensible of anything but paine which in a great measure he endured by his
most violent screamings &amp; was often in strong convulsions in his bowells which he then
exprest by applying his hands to those parts.</p>

<p>The Sheriffs having ordered him back to Newgate he was carryed out in a
blankett putt into a Coach &amp; was seemingly much composed &amp; quiet not making any
manner of noise wherein 3 or 4 days time he recovered sufficient to converse &amp; eat &amp;
drink very freely but never could give any reasonable account of what had passed. He
afterwards obtained a reprieve in order to be transported for life which he was accordingly
in the 16th year of his age. (<i>Vide</i> his Tryall in the Sessions paper of that time.)</p></div>

the period of Incorporation
(1462), if not earlier, the Company
took care to provide for
the professional education of its
members and apprentices, and
to increase their proficiency in
Surgical science.</p>

<p class="ti0em tac fs80 htmlonly">The initial letter <span class="antiqua">T</span> is reduced from one in the Audit Book, 1612–13.</p>

<p>In addition to the Examiners in Surgery (who though not
necessarily members of the Court of Assistants were often consulted
by the Masters or Governors) there were chosen “Masters and
Stewards of the Anatomy,” generally two Masters and two Stewards,<span class="pagenum" title="362"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a></span>
on whom devolved the duty of conducting the Demonstrations, and
arranging for the Dinners which invariably followed. The exact
duties of these officials are not at all times clearly defined, though
elsewhere will be found allusions to, and orders concerning their
offices and functions, but it may be generally taken that the Stewards
dissected and prepared the body, the Masters reading the Lectures
thereon to the assembled Surgeons and their apprentices.</p>

<p>These Demonstrations usually took place four times in the year,
and were termed “Public Anatomies,” from the fact that the subject
was generally a public body, <i>i.e.</i>, a malefactor, and the attendance of
the free Surgeons was compulsory on these occasions; besides these
Public Anatomies, there were also an indefinite number of “Private
Anatomies” held at the Hall, and at these the attendance was by
invitation. It was illegal for any one to dissect a “humane bodye”
within the limits of the Company’s jurisdiction without the permission
of the Masters or Governors, and whenever a Surgeon was desirous
to anatomatize some specially interesting subject, it was termed a
“Private Anatomy,” and generally performed at the Hall by permission,
the Surgeon inviting his own friends and pupils, and the
Court inviting whom they chose. (See the curious entry as to a
Private Anatomy, page <a href="#Page_321">321</a>.)</p>

<p>Besides the Demonstrations of Anatomy, public and private,
there were several other lectures delivered (oftentimes once a week) by
members of the College of Physicians and members of the Company;
two of these, which were trusts, the Arrisian Lecture and Gale’s
Anatomy still survive I believe, at the Royal College of Surgeons;
the others were provided by the Company out of their corporate funds.</p>

1556–9, whence he removed to London. He wrote a letter prefacing
John Hall’s book against the “beastlye abusers” of Surgery,

where as M<sup>r</sup> Docto<sup>r</sup> Gwin our lecturer is lately dead by reason whereof wee are destitute of

formerly the Surgions of this house hath bene used, whereupon deliberac͠on being had it
is by this Court fully concluded and agreed that our weekely lectures shalbe reade

Surgerye by an approved surgion of this Companie, this Court did againe deliberate upon

<p>30th January, 1646. The draft deed of settlement for the
Arrisian Lectures was brought into Court and (6th February, 1646)
approved; but it appearing at the next Court that there was some
technical difficulty as to the names of the feoffees it was remitted to
the donor’s counsel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>20th February, 1646. This Court doth agree That the Deed of an Annuity

and for establishing the said new Anatomy was sealed with the Com̃on Seale and
Delivered to the Donor and the severall ffeoffees intrusted in that matter.</p></div>

<p>In consequence of our later Minutes being lost, it is not possible
to say precisely how this trust came to be varied and increased, though
from the House of Commons Journals (see <a href="#Page_160">p.&nbsp;160</a>) it can be conjectured
almost to a certainty to have been as follows:&mdash;Within twelve
years from the date of the original grant (say in 1658) the Company
returned the £300 to Alderman Arris, and he thereupon settled upon
them a rent charge, not of £24 as he had promised to do, but of £30
per annum payable out of some of his houses. He seems however,
subsequently, to have had good reason to believe that his only son
and heir, Dr. Thomas Arris, M.P., would give the Company trouble
in the matter of the settlement, and so, on the 29th February, 1676,
he requested that his deed of grant might be given up to him cancelled,
and that he should in return give the Company £510 absolutely and
free from any trust, save only an honorable understanding that the<span class="pagenum" title="370"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a></span>
Anatomy Lectures should be continued. This was done, and after his
death (which happened 28th May, 1676) the Company were involved
in a Chancery suit with Dr. Thomas Arris who endeavoured, though
unsuccessfully, to recover possession of the £510.</p>

<span class="smcap">The</span> Great Book of Wardens’ Accounts has unfortunately
been kept in a damp place, and the earlier portion of
it is severely damaged. The cover still indicates the
elaboration of the bookbinder’s art, being stamped in
patterns with the portcullis fleur de lys and Tudor
rose; opposite what is left of the first page is a
magnificently painted achievement of the Company’s arms on vellum,
but this unhappily, is damaged.</p>

<p>The first page has rotted almost entirely away, leaving only the
upper left hand corner, on which there is an initial letter T illuminated
in the highest style of art, though this is also seriously damaged.</p>

<p>The accounts commence with those for the year 1603, the first
few pages are worn away, pages 7 to 36 are but slightly damaged,
whilst the remainder of this huge book is quite perfect and abounds
with quaint and artistic initial letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="380"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a></span></p>

his castigator. See more fully as to this in the amusing foot note
on p.&nbsp;423, Vol. I, of Herbert’s Livery Companies.</p>

<p>These contributions were voluntary and are accounted for every
year for a considerable period. At the end of the book is a long and
detailed list of the contributors, commencing 23rd April, 1668, and
extending to March, 1681. There seem to have been 398 subscribers,
and the sum collected from them was £1,850; this amount, however,
was wholly inadequate for the rebuilding of the hall, which appears by
entries extending over 1668 to 1674, to have cost the Company no less
than £4,292. The deficit was made up by sales of freehold property
in the City, for what to us, in these days, would seem absurdly low
prices, and by loans, etc.</p>

<p>The Livery dinners on these occasions were paid for by
the Stewards.</p>

<p>The next book of Accounts extends from 1785 to 1821, but
like the latter part of the last one it is almost destitute of interest.
On the first page is an extract from the Will of Mr. Edward Griffin
(10th April, 1596) relating to his gift to the Company, and there
are also sundry memoranda concerning Banckes’ gift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="421"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a></span></p>

<p>1785. This was the last occasion on which the Company
“went out” on Lord Mayor’s day.</p>

<p>In addition to the Wardens’ accounts, there are two books
containing receipts of tradesmen and others for money paid to them
extending from 1722 to 1764. These books are not specially
interesting, excepting that they contain autographs of a few
eminent Surgeons, hangmen and others, and the following extracts
will <span class="nowrap">suffice:&mdash;</span></p>

<h2>DISPUTES.</h2>


<p>1388. One of our earliest ordinances enacts <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">If any dispute arise between any of the brethren, which God forbid, it is to be
amicably settled by the decision of the Masters of the said Fraternity and they are to deal
plainly<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span> and that no one sue another in other manner than at the assize, and then only
if he be empowered by leave of the said Masters to be recorded.
</p></div>

<p>1530. And again in the ordinances signed by Sir Thomas
More, it states <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">yff any matter of stryffe or debate herafter be betwene eny pˀson of the said
Crafte as God fforfende that noon of them shall make eny <span class="nowrap">pˀsuts<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span> in the Comen lawe

Maisters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to thˀentent that they shall ordre the said matter or cause of
complaynt so made yff they can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p></div>

<p>This prerogative of the Company was jealously guarded, and
indeed extended, the Court becoming in effect a sort of Court
of Conscience, in which <i>non-freemen</i> frequently appeared as plaintiffs
against freemen, when their cases were heard and adjudicated upon, the
Court settling the amount and time of payment, or dismissing the suit.</p>

<p>Whenever (as often happened) one freeman went to law with
another, without leave of the Court, and the defendant complained,<span class="pagenum" title="424"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a></span>
the plaintiff was ordered to withdraw his action, and if he declined to
do so, an opportunity of reflection upon the powers of the Company
was afforded him in the seclusion of the “Compter.”</p>

<p>It was frequently the custom for the Masters to require both
parties to enter into bonds to abide the decision of the Court, and
where this was not so, and either of them disobeyed the order made,
the offender was either fined, imprisoned or expelled.</p>

<p>The following are a few notices of cases of dispute which came
before the Court from time to time, and other instances will be found
elsewhere.</p>

<p>30th June, 1551. It was <span class="nowrap">ordered&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">That James Wood John Chamber and William Drewe Waterman shalbe lovers
and friendes and clerlye to acquite and discharge either other of and from all maner of
acc͠ons quarrells detts demaundes and suts as well spirytuall as temporall whatsoever
they be from the begynnyng of the worlde untyll the daye abovesayd.</p></div>

<p>4th November, 1551. <span class="nowrap">Ordered&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">That John West shall bring in his fyne which is vj<sup>s</sup> viij<sup>d</sup> for speking opprobryous
wordes against John Androwson in the presence of the M<sup>r.</sup></p></div>

<p>2nd May, 1552. It was ordered and declared that Harry Cooke
and Nicholas <span class="nowrap">Connysbye&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">are fully condescended concluded and agreed for all maner of acc͠ons dettes
suetts demaunds and quarrells whatsoever they be from the begynnynge of the worlde unto
this daye and that they shall clerly dischardge eche other and to be lovers and freinds.</p></div>

<p>1566. By an entry in this year it seems that each disputant
when before the Court was “put to his othe upon a booke y<sup>t</sup> he sholde
saye the trothe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="425"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a></span></p>

<p>10th December, 1566. Thomas Lambkyn appeared against
his late apprentice W<sup>m</sup> <span class="nowrap">Woodfall&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In this Courte here was John Hawkes playntyf agaynst Richard Olkar for his
unfyttinge words &amp; Olkar shalbe here the nexte courte.</p></div>

<p>30th December, 1566. William Collins the covenant servant
of John Johnson complained of his master for “myssusing hym in his
boxe money,” whereupon M<sup>r</sup> Johnson was ordered to amend his ways.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4th March, 1567. Here was Walter Lynche for his unfytting wordꝭ seyeng y<sup>t</sup>
Richard Dycson sholde be got his mayde w<sup>th</sup> chylde and Lynche denyeth yt, y<sup>t</sup> he nevˀ

<p>11th March, 1567. In this Court here was John Wall for y<sup>t</sup> he warned John Staple

pˀvyded &amp; ordayned.</p></div>

<p>Edward Park, who was a troublesome fellow, and often before
the Court, would seem (by the next extract) to have revived the old
scandal about Dycson and his “mayde,” <span class="nowrap">for&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">14th November, 1567. Here was Rich. Dycson playntyf agaynst Edward
Parke for undecent and slaunderous words And they both have consented to put yt

<p>13th January, 1568. In thys Courte here was John Cooke playntyf against Rich<sup>d</sup>
Barker for serten wordꝭ undecently spoken by Rich<sup>d</sup> against the said John and also for
serten housold stuff y<sup>t</sup> the said Rich<sup>d</sup> Barker w<sup>th</sup>holdeth frome the said John, and they
both are comaunded the nexte courte daye to brynge in bothe y<sup>r</sup> fynes vj<sup>s</sup> viij<sup>d</sup> a pece for

<p>7th June, 1569. In this Courte here was the wyf of John Burges for that Rich.
Barker beate black her armes and yt is ordered that the said Rich. Barker shall upon this
pˀsent daye go unto the house of the said John Burges his m<sup>r</sup> and y<sup>r</sup> acknowledge hym
sylf to be sory for trespassynge hym &amp; his wyf.</p>

<p>19th July, 1569. Here was John Charnock, said that he is his M<sup>rs</sup> <span class="nowrap">pntꝭ<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span>

did hym wronge &amp; y<sup>t</sup> he wolde at lawe trye yt and unreverently he did behave
hymsylf w<sup>th</sup> stoute &amp; undecent [words] &amp; so he charged the M<sup>r</sup> styll, but not the
worsshypfulls of this Courte.</p>

<p>18th November, 1572. Here was one Edward Browne Bricklayer and complayned
[against] one Richard Upton for that he had taken his money for curynge hym of Morbus
Gallicus but the sicknes as he said was not cured &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Upton pˀmised to agree w<sup>th</sup> hym.</p></div>

<p>The next is a rare piece of tittle tattle; like Edward Park,
Colley was often in trouble, and it is amusing to observe how he
shortly afterwards lays an information against Carrington, which
compliment Carrington returns to him in the March Court.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>18th November, 1572. Here was Willm̃ Carington and required his complaint to
be herd in that Allein Colley had slaundered hym w<sup>th</sup> unhonest wordes, that is, that Allein
should say that Wiberds wife should say that Charringtons wief should not be honest, and
they were pˀmytted to take ordre of Lawe.</p></div>

<p>10th February, 1573. Colley laid an information against Carrington
for “Trimminge on a Sondaye,” whereupon he was fined 40<i>s.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="427"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a></span></p>

<p>11th March, 1573. Carrington complained of Colley “for undecent
wordes calling him verlet before the Mr.,” etc., and they were
ordered to be friends, and to bring no more complaints against each
other.</p>

<p>This feud seems, however, to have continued for a few
years, but was at last happily settled, for we read under date, 24th
January, 1576:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here at this Co<sup>r</sup>te witnesses being hard betwene Willm̃ Carrington and Allen
Collye they were made frendes, shoke handes and frendly depˀted.</p>

<p>2nd March, 1573. Here was a complaint agaynste Henrye Lushe by John
Parradize for that the said Henry Lushe called the said John Paradize knave, and he p<sup>d</sup>
his fyne xij<sup>d</sup> and they toke hands &amp; were ffrends.</p>

<p>19th April, 1574. Here was Willm̃ Brode and brought in an answere agaynste
the complaynt of Edward Saunders for lykeninge hym to Esoppes dogge and they were
appoynted to be ffrends and to brynge the matter no more in question.</p></div>

<p>Was this the “dog in the manger”? Anyhow, it seems a trivial
matter to have been brought before the grave old Masters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2nd February, 1575. Here came one Willm̃ Goodnep and complayned of Willm̃
Clowes for not curing his wief de morbo gallico and yt was awarded that the saide Clowes
sholde either geve the saide Goodnep xx<sup>s</sup> orells cure his saide wief, w<sup>ch</sup> Clowes agreed to

<p>28th February, 1576. Here was a complainte against Willm̃ Clowes by one
Goodenge for that the saide Clowes had not onlie misused the saide Goodinge in speeche
but also most of the masters of the Companye w<sup>th</sup> scoffing wordes and jestes and they all
forgave him here openlye in the Co<sup>r</sup>te and so the stryfe was ended upon condˀ that he
shold nev<sup>r</sup> so misuse him self a gayne, and bonds was caused to be made to that effect.</p>

<p>25th September, 1576. At this Coˀte came Willm̃ Wise and Mathew Ken, and
divers evell and unbrotherlike speches was pˀved and so the saide Willm̃ Wise confest his
falt paide his ffyne and made a breakfast to the Companie for their paynes, and so they
shoke hands and were made ffrends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="428"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">There</span> are numerous excellent examples of the Company’s
Arms at the Hall. The records contain many
beautiful drawings and emblazoned shields of arms,
not only of the Company but of some of the
Masters as well.</p>

<p>One of the choicest specimens is the massive old carving beneath
the semicircular canopy of the entrance doorway; this is dated 1671,
and is both bold and quaint; long may it be preserved to the Barbers!
The carved coat of arms which formerly ornamented the stern of the
Company’s barge, and which is probably late 17th century work, has
been carefully preserved, and may be always admired over the chimney
piece in the Committee room. There is the large “tortershell” in the
vestibule given by Mr. William Kings in 1645. The cloth on the
Court table is artistically embroidered with the Arms of the Company
and the City, the embroidered portions being part of the ancient
barge cloth. There is a handsomely emblazoned coat of arms on the
plan of the Company’s property (presented by Mr. Charles John
Shoppee), and a pretty little bit of old stained glass in the window
on the first floor landing. The Company formerly possessed a great
many banners, but these are unfortunately lost to us; the one which<span class="pagenum" title="432"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a></span>
is placed behind the Master’s chair is beautifully painted by Bishop
of Doctors’ Commons, and has at the back the <span class="nowrap">inscription&mdash;</span></p>

simply the first quarter of our present achievement; sable, a chevron
between three fleams argent, the fleams being mediæval lancets, though
from their shape they have sometimes been thought to represent
razors. This coat was borne by both the Barbers and their successors,
the Barber-Surgeons, until the time of Elizabeth. The grant is

<p>1492. In this year a cognizance, or possibly an informal grant
of arms, was given to the Surgeons’ Company; this is depicted on
the first leaf in the beautiful old vellum book of Ordinances at the
Hall, the inscription under, stating that it was given to the Craft
of Surgeons of London in the year 1492, at the going over the sea
into France of Henry VII. (<i>See</i> the fac-simile at <a href="#Page_68">p.&nbsp;68</a>.)</p>

<p>No other authority than the above statement is known for this
coat, but in the grant to the Barber-Surgeons (1569) it is recited that
Henry VIII granted the Company of Surgeons a cognizance “which
is a spatter thereon a rose gules crowned golde for their warrant in
fielde but no authoritie by warrant for the bearinge of the same in
shilde as armes.” The Herald in drawing the grant of 1569 probably
accidentally put in the name of Henry VIII for that of Henry VII,
the entry in our book being undoubtedly coeval with the circumstance.
We here get the foundations of our present coat of arms; the fleams
representing the old Barber-Surgeons or Barbers, and the crowned
rose and spatula the Surgeons proper, both of which were introduced
into one shield in 1561, and quartered in 1569.</p>

<p>On either side of the shield of the Surgeons’ Arms stands a
Saint habited as a doctor or physician, one of whom holds a medical
vessel in his right hand, while the other has a box of ointment and a
spatula, indicative of their being professors of the healing art. These
are the patron Saints of the Company, Cosmus and Damianus. Mrs.
Jameson states that <span class="nowrap">they&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ti0em mt-05em">were two brothers, Arabians by birth but they dwelt in Ægæ, a city of Cilicia. Their
father having died while they were yet children, their pious mother Theodora, brought
them up with all diligence, and in the practice of every Christian virtue. Their charity
was so great, that not only they lived in the greatest abstinence, distributing their goods
to the infirm and poor, but they studied medicine and surgery, that they might be able
to prescribe for the sick, and relieve the sufferings of the wounded and infirm; and the<span class="pagenum" title="434"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a></span>
blessing of God being on all their endeavours, they became the most learned and the
most perfect physicians that the world had ever seen. They ministered to all who
applied to them, whether rich or poor. Even to suffering animals they did not deny
their aid, and they constantly refused all payment or recompense, exercising their art only
for charity and for the love of God; and thus they spent their days.</p></div>

<p>In the cover of a Latin Bible, printed in 1470, I discovered
some vellum padding, which on examination proved to be a MS. of
XIth century, consisting of part of a collection of the lives of the
Saints, interspersed with prayers, etc., and which probably had been
read in some Convent refectory during the hours of meals. This MS.
is moreover curious, as those portions intended to be sung have certain
signs affixed, known as “neumes,” which, before the more modern
method of musical notation was introduced, were employed to denote
musical expression. An account of the martyrdom of Cosmo and
Damian, together with their brothers, is here preserved, but as the
original is in very contracted Latin, the following translation will,
perhaps, better supply its <span class="nowrap">place:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The souls of Cosmus and Damianus the Just are in the hands of God.</p>

<p>There have moreover been crowned these five brothers Cosmus, Damianus,
Antimeus, Leuntius and Eutrepius.</p>

<p>Furthermore we beseech Thee, Almighty God, to grant that we, who commemorate
the nativities of thy Saints Cosmus and Damianus, may by their intercessions
be delivered from all present and future evils. Amen. The blessed martyrs Cosmus
Damianus, Antimeus, Leuntius and Eutrepius, were committed to prison by order of the
governor; and on the following day, the proconsul sitting on the judgment seat, caused
an enormous fire to be made, and the above-named men to be led out of prison and cast
into its midst. But on account of their prayers the fire lost its power over these saints.
The governor was astounded, and the executioner, thinking that the circumstances which
had happened with regard to the martyrs of God depended on their magical arts,
ordered them to be again interrogated. But, when they remained firm with a cheerful
and joyous countenance rendered more noble by torture, he ordered crosses to be made,
and the martyrs, when stretched upon them, to be pelted with stones. Accordingly, when<span class="pagenum" title="435"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a></span>
the blows recoiled on those that delivered them, the governor, inflamed with excessive
rage, gave orders to attack them with arrows, so that at a less distance the steel might at
least penetrate. But, although he had not been able to injure them in any way, many of
those who discharged arrows and who stood near withdrew on account of the wounds
that they received.</p>

<p>For so is the testimony.</p>

<p>Seeing accordingly that his ill will was overcome by Divine power, the governor
ordered them to be mutilated with a sword.</p>

<p>The blessed martyrs were put to death on the Twentieth day of September; and
their bodies were buried by devout men in a holy spot not far from the city of Ægae.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Jameson relates a legend somewhat similar to the above,
and states that it was of great antiquity, being transplanted into Western
Europe in the first ages of Christianity. The Emperor Justinian,
having been recovered, as he supposed, from a dangerous illness by
the intercession of these saints, erected a superb church in their honour.
Among the Greeks they succeeded to the worship and attributes of
Æsculapius; and from their disinterested refusal of all pay or reward,
they are distinguished by the honourable title of Anargyres, which
signifies moneyless, or without fees. These saints are commemorated
on the 27th September, and all over Europe have ever been the patron
saints of the Barbers and Surgeons; they
are also the patrons of the Medici family,
and as such they figure on the coins of
Florence.</p>

<p>1540. In the bowl of the grace cup
given by Henry VIII to the Barber-Surgeons,
the arms of the Barbers impaling
the Surgeons are cut, but this is merely the
fancy of an engraver, and of later date than
the cup.</p>

<p>10th July, 1561. In the Heralds’ College (I.C.B., No. 101, 20)
is a grant of arms by William Harvey, Clarencieux King of Arms, to
the Barber-Surgeons,
in which he grants
and assigns unto them
for an “augmentac͠on
to ther old and aunscint
Armes (which is
sables a chevrone
between thre flumes
argent) a chef paly
argent &amp; vert on a
pale goles a lyon passant
regardant gold
betwene two spatters
argent a roze gewles
crowned golde &amp; to
ther creast upon the
healme an opinacus
golde standing upon a wreath argent and sables manteled gewles
dubled argent.”</p>

<p>1565. This year, Harvey, Clarencieux, granted two supporters
to the above arms, namely, “two lynxe in their proper Collor about
there necks a crowne with a cheyne argent.”</p>

<p>1568. This year, Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy, Kings of
Arms, ratified and confirmed the above arms, crest, and supporters,
with the following variations, the arms to be borne quarterly, “the
ffyrst sables a cheveron bytwyne iij flewmes argent, the second
quarter per pale argent and vert on a spatter of the fyrst a Dobele
<span class="pagenum" title="437"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a></span>rose gules and argent crowned or, over all on a crosse gules a lyon
passant Regardant or.”</p>

<p>12th June, 1569. The grant of Arms by Dethick, etc., is a
beautifully artistic production, though, unfortunately, slightly damaged,
and the seals are missing. In 1885 the Company had it reproduced
in chromo-photography by Mr. William Griggs, whose work has
been so skilfully executed that it is difficult to observe the least
difference between the original and the copies.</p>

<p>With this grant is the first appearance of a motto “De
præscientia Dei.” How this motto came to be chosen, or in what
way it applies to the Barber-Surgeons, I am at a loss to point out.
The following is the text of the grant.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this grant recites that it plainly appeared
that the grant of 10th July, 1561, was [<i>a.</i>] contrary to the words of the
Corporation (<i>i.e.</i>, Incorporation) of the said Barbers and Surgeons, and
[<i>b.</i>] contrary to and not agreeing with the ancient laws and rules of
arms.</p>

<p>With regard to the former assertion [<i>a.</i>] I take it that the grant
being made to the “Master and Governors of the Corporation Mystery
and Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons” and <i>not</i> to the “Masters
and Governors of the Mystery and Commonalty of Barbers and
Surgeons of London” as they are styled in the Act 32 Hen. VIII,
offended the precise Heralds of 1569, and that it was indeed a technical
defect and contrary to the exact words of the incorporation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="442"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a></span></p>

<p>As to the second point [<i>b.</i>] there cannot be any doubt but that
Hervey committed a violation of one of the fundamental and most
ancient laws of heraldry, viz., that colour must not be on colour (nor
metal on metal). He gave the Company on their old sable field, a
chief with gules and vert thereon! This greatly shocked old Garter,
Clarencieux, and Norroy, and enabled them, whilst recording the
blunder of one of their predecessors, to extract a good fee from the
Barber-Surgeons for a new grant.</p>

and there are unscrupulous persons who do not
hesitate to affirm that the Courts of the Companies
act as fraudulent trustees, and are consenting parties
to the malversation of trust and charity property,
eating up money which it is audaciously pretended belongs to the
“people of London.”</p>

<p>These statements have been assiduously put forth by a
certain class of politicians whose acquaintance with the true details
of the case must be absolutely nil, and who it is but reasonable
to suppose, are willing to assume that the gentlemen who manage
the affairs of the Companies are in the habit of acting as their
traducers would do, had they but the opportunity.</p>

<p>To any one conversant with the history and management of
the Livery Guilds, these assertions are known to be false. Here
and there, as in every concern in life, improprieties and errors in
judgment may have occurred, but it is confidently asserted, and
capable of proof, that no charitable or trust funds suffer from<span class="pagenum" title="444"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a></span>
feasting; indeed, on the contrary, the practice has obtained for
centuries, with but few exceptions, for the members of the guilds
to themselves supply the funds which are spent upon their entertainment,
and for the surplus accumulations of these funds to be
applied <i>to the augmentation of charities and trusts</i>. It has certainly
been so in the Barber-Surgeons’ Company, and for a long period
the calls upon the Livery for feasting purposes (when the custom
was to nominate Stewards in rotation) were a severe strain upon
the members, and occasioned great irritation and ill-feeling.</p>

<p>The earliest practice in the Companies would appear to be
that the Livery and their wives attending the feasts, paid a stipulated
sum per head, and we know this by our records to have been so
in our Company long before the time of Richard II. This custom
was altered in later times, and we find that certain appointed entertainments
were given on fixed days, to which all members were
invited, and which were paid for by fines laid down upon admission
to the freedom, and further fines on going on to the Livery and
Court. In addition to this, each Liveryman had, in his turn, to
serve “the office of Steward,” that is, to join with four or five others
in providing the costs of certain dinners<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span></p>

<p>The fees on admission into the Companies are greatly in excess
of the ancient ones, and it is mainly from this source of revenue that
the expenses of the feasts are now defrayed. It is so in the Barbers’
Company, but, if at any time these funds have temporarily been found
insufficient for the purpose, they have been supplemented from a
property, which is in no sense a Charity Estate, or subject to any trust
whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="445"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a></span></p>

<p>There have been and are, good men of business on the Courts,
and by prudent investments of surplus funds derived from fees, fines,
etc., a property has been created, which is exclusively their very own
to deal with as they please. We have, amongst many others, the
opinion of Lord Chancellor Selborne very decisively to this effect, and
also one, which by the traducers of the Companies ought to be respected,
for it is that of Sir Horace Davey, Q.C., who was consulted by the
Livery Companies’ Commission&mdash;a Commission notoriously hostile to
the guilds. Sir H. Davey stated that they would “not be justified in
recommending that the corporate property of the Companies should
be taken from them by the State.” He further reported that, such
an act “would be an act of <i>confiscation</i>, and would not unreasonably
shake the confidence of the owners of property in the security of
the rights of property. It must be remembered that the Estates of
these Companies have been recognised, and held by the Courts of
Law, to be as much their property with a full right of disposition,
as the property of individuals.” Truly, the Commissioners must have
said to their legal adviser as Balak of old said to Baalam, “I took
thee to curse mine enemies, and behold thou hast blessed them
altogether!”</p>

<p>It is a pleasing characteristic of all true Englishmen that they
love to meet together around a festive board; while their hospitality in
inviting their friends, or the eminent and great in all sections of society
to partake with them has happily not gone out of fashion, and, spite of
the sour critics of the guilds, we fervently trust that it never may.</p>

<p>1388. In the return to a writ, 12th Richard II, the Masters of
the Barbers certified, amongst other matters, that it was their practice
“once a year to assemble to feast,” and that they had an ordinance
by which none of the brotherhood were to pay more than 14<i>d.</i> each
towards the feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="446"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a></span></p>

<p>10th May, 1435. Among the Ordinances of the Surgeons was
one that each member was to “paie ʒeerli to the dyner of the craft
that is to seie oonys aʒeer on the dai of Seint luke ech man lich mich
whethir he be pˀsent or absent,” <i>i.e.</i>, once a year on St. Luke’s day
each man was to pay like much whether present or absent.</p>

<p>28th September, 1503. It was ordained that every member
attending the dinner the day on which the Wardens were presented
to the Lord Mayor was to pay 20<i>d.</i>, and if he brought his wife with
him, then 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The Barber-Surgeons from the earliest times appear to have
entertained the ladies at certain feasts, and their unique toast “The
Good Wives, Merry Maids and Buxom Widows of the Worshipful
Company of Barbers” is traditionally said to have had its origin in
Elizabeth’s time.</p>

<p>14th May, 1530. The following is amongst the ordinances
signed by Sir Thomas More at this <span class="nowrap">date&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="447"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a></span></p>

<p>8th July, 1552. The earliest entry in the Court Minutes on this
subject is a doleful one, for it was ordered “That there shalbe no dynner
kept this yere.”</p>

<p>19th September, 1552. William Bette was appointed “Cooke
for the Hall,” and Steven Reede the “Butler.” John Edwards (a
Freeman) was to supply the flowers on the feast days.</p>

<p>28th July, 1555. It was ordered that the Masters should have
a yearly allowance of £7 for the Election dinner, and that none should
be at the dinner but Liverymen.</p>

<p>22nd July, 1556. This allowance was increased to £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>20th February, 1567. Henry Smith, yeoman to Lord Robert
Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was admitted to the freedom, and because
he had been frankly and freely admitted to the freedom of the City at
the suit of the Duke of Norfolk, the Marquess of Northampton and the
Earl of Leicester, he paid nothing but 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and 4<i>d.</i> for entering his

<p>25th August, 1600. There having been abuses at the feasts, an
order was made for their reformation which <span class="nowrap">stated&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">that the bodye of this Company hath susteyned much disparagement by reason
that some of the livery and others noe white at all respectinge the worshipp of this

<p>An order was also made that no Assistant should have more than one
servant or apprentice to attend upon him and his wife at any feast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>21st January, 1601. Whereas by the death of Robert Gray late Cooke to this
Company the house was unfurnished of a Cooke to serve the said mistery And therefore
divers Cookes became this daie shewters to this Courte for the place of the said Robert
Gray beinge then voyd, yet notwithstandinge forasmuch as Margaret Grey wiefe to the
said Robert Grey became an humble Suter to the said Courte for the same place, it was
ordered by the whole consente of this Courte That the said Margeret Grey be admitted

deputy beinge such a pˀsonn as the M<sup>rs</sup> of this Company for the tyme beinge shall like

<p>Margery, however, does not seem to have “honestlie and
sufficientlie behaved her selfe,” for as appears by an <span class="nowrap">entry&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">6th May, 1602. This daye Margery Grey late wyef to Robert Grey was dismissed

<p>The Plague was raging severely in London in 1603, and the
following precept was addressed to the Company, who however
seem to have disregarded it, as the Election and Audit dinners
were held this year. It is only fair, however, to state that
the Court disbursed considerable sums of money amongst the poor
stricken people.</p>

<p>1609. The dinners were usually held on Election and Audit
days, on Lord Mayor’s day, and after all public dissections, besides
Committee dinners (which usually were at taverns), and this year it was
ordered that a dinner was to be held on “Gunpowder Day.”</p>

the Livery should give towardꝭ the charge of the musicke on the Election day vj<sup>d</sup> a peice

<p>The reason of the next order was, that in consequence of the
poverty of the Company at this time, the usual allowance of £8 made
by the Court towards the Mayor’s feast, could not be granted.</p>

<p>21st January, 1613. It was ordered that the Master and
Wardens, with four of the Ancient Masters, should for the “worship
&amp; credytt of this Company,” yearly go and visit the Lord Mayor at
dinner, and that 20<i>s.</i> each should be allowed them for their “charges”
of the same. This allowance of 20<i>s.</i> each was probably given to some
officer of the Lord Mayor to secure his favour towards the Company.</p>

<p>6th February, 1613. An order was made that at the dinner
after any private anatomy, any of the Livery, either Barbers or
Surgeons, might come thereto on payment of 12<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>16th September, 1613. This daie it is thought fitt &amp; ordered that the widdowes

<p>10th July, 1615. At this Court it is ordered that the Cooke shalbe removed &amp;

<p>20th June, 1638. Upon the complaint of the losse of a silver spoone the last
dinner in the Hall and diver other times napkins &amp; pewter dishes this Court doth
order that when dinner goes in, the outer Wickett doore shalbe alwayes locked &amp;
the key thereof brought in and layed by o<sup>r</sup> M<sup>r</sup> for the time being till dinner be ended

<p>The next entry would seem to indicate that some previous
gift for the purchase of books had unhappily been diverted into a
wrong channel.</p>

<p>2nd March, 1640. £6 given by Mistress Napkin &amp; Mistriss Eaton is

<p>The following circumstance is significant, as exactly one
hundred years later the separation which Mr. Foster desired, and for
which he got into trouble, became an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>6th November, 1645. Mr. Ralph Foster was complained of
for refusing to make his dinner to the Court on his election as an
Assistant, and he thereupon uttered certain speeches “tending to the
separation of the Barbers from the Surgeons,” for which he was
reprimanded, whereupon he promised to make his dinner and to say no
more about disunion.</p>

<p>23rd October, 1649. Upon reading the precept requiring
the Livery to attend the Lord Mayor Elect to Westminster in their
Barge, it was ordered that the Livery should be warned to perform<span class="pagenum" title="455"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a></span>
that service in accordance with old custom, and “that there be a ffeast
at the Hall on that day for the said Livery, But in respect of the
hardnes and troubles of the times this Court doth consent that there
be noe second course and noe Woeman at the same ffeast.”</p>

<p>Among the Company’s archives are four books containing many
details of the feasts held between the years 1676 and 1790. They
appear to have been kept by the various cooks, probably under the
direction of the Clerk, and the following gleanings from them will
be found to be replete with interest.</p>

<p>20th September, 1709. It was ordered, in consequence of the
great increase in the Livery, that there should be six instead of five
stewards of the Mayor’s Feast to make the Livery dinner, and any
liveryman chosen to the office and refusing to serve was to be
prosecuted under the by-laws. The fine for not serving was £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
and was invariably enforced, numerous cases of refusal being decided
at law in favour of the Company. Six Whifflers were as usual,
appointed “to be attendant upon the Govern<sup>rs</sup> at the Hall upon the
next Lord Mayo<sup>rs</sup> day in comely &amp; decent Apparrell with gilded
Chaines &amp; white Staves.”</p>

<p>6th November, 1717. In consequence of irregularities at
the Lord Mayor’s feast, it was ordered that in future the Stewards
should be prohibited from bringing their wives and friends to the dinner.</p>

<p>1721. The third dinner book opens with an account of the
receipts of the Governors’ “Potation Money” for this year, amounting
to £131 11<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, the contributions being from Barbers one guinea,
and from Surgeons two guineas each. This potation money was
spent at the Mitre Tavern in Fleet Street, on ten Monthly Court
dinners, which averaged the modest sum of £4 4<i>s.</i> apiece, and the
remainder was disbursed about the election feast, wine and sundries.</p>

<p>The cost of the Mayor’s feast this year was £67 7<i>s.</i>, and at
this dinner was drunk a hogshead of port (query), six gallons of
mountain, six gallons of white port, and three gallons of canary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="462"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a></span></p>

<p class="ti0em mt-08em">and 4<i>s.</i> were expended on tobacco and pipes.</p>

<p>1726. The monthly Court dinners were held at the George
and Vulture Tavern, nine of them costing in all £29 13<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The Election dinner this year cost £91 8<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i></p>

<p>And the Lord Mayor’s feast £72 1<i>s.</i> 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub><i>d.</i></p>

<p>June, 1729. The monthly Court dinner was held at “Vaux
Hall.”</p>

<p>The accounts throughout the Third Dinner Book (1720–1740)
appear to be much the same every year. First is a list of receipts
for Potation Money, averaging about £100 per annum, then follow
the allowances out of the same towards the Election dinner, the
dressing it and use of pewter, about £19 in all, the payments for
the monthly Court dinners (nine or ten at about £4 4<i>s.</i> each), and
the expenses of the Election feasts, about £80 to £90 a piece.</p>

<p>The cost of the Lord Mayor’s feast, the Livery feast, and
the Ladies’ feast, was borne by the Stewards.</p>

<p>There were gay doings at some of these dinners, as witness
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1726. Paid the Boy who danced the anticks at the Lady’s feast, 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>1727. By Cash paid the Butchers who played to the Company with their
Marrow bones and cleavers on Lord Mayor’s day, 1<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="463"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a></span></p>

<p>And there were sometimes rather shady doings after the
dinners, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>10th July, 1729. Mem̃dm. M<sup>r</sup> Truelove &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Fradin carried away y<sup>e</sup> next
morning after y<sup>e</sup> feast four Dozen Quarts of Wine, One whole Venison pasty, One
whole Goose, one whole fowl, &amp; several lemons &amp; sugar.</p>
</div>

<p>1st February, 1732. Mr. John Atkinson and the other
Stewards of the Mayor’s feast, employed a cook of their own, and
“did make a most scandalous Dinner for y<sup>e</sup> Co.,” whereupon order
was given that in future no other than the “Standing Cooke” of
the Company should be employed.</p>

<p>One is astounded at the quantity of wine which appears to
have been imbibed at some of these dinners; take, for example, the
following on Lord Mayor’s Day, 1735, and note that it is especially
stated that the wine was “drank at the said feast”:</p>

<p>By the above account these thirsty old Barber-Surgeons seem

<p><span class="pagenum" title="464"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a></span></p>

<p>15th July, 1736. 56 gallons of wine were drunk at the Ladies’
feast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>21st July, 1726. It is order<sup>d</sup> That from henceforward at all publick Feasts or
Dinners to be held or made at the Hall the Cook of the Company for the time being
shall before he sends the Dinner into the Hall deliver to the Clark of the Company at his
House his Messe of meat consisting of six compleat dishes according to the Ancient laws
and usage of the Company in that behalf the same being the ancient ffee &amp; Perquisite
of the Clerk.</p>
</div>

<p>21st August, 1729. The above order was vacated in consequence
of disputes as to the contents and number of the dishes supplied to the
Clerk, and it was ordered that the Clerk should receive £5 5<i>s.</i> annually
in lieu of his “messe of meat,” and also that he should dine at all the
feasts “as he has always been accustomed to do.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1st February, 1731. For the better regulating of the Ladys Feast It is ordered
That every Member of the Court of Assistants shall besides his Lady and one daughter
have three tickets to be delivered to such persons as they shall think fitt to be admitted to
come and dance at the Hall at Five of the Clock on that day and that there shall be two
Constables to attend at the Hall gate and see that nobody is admitted but with such
Ticketts and that the Ticketts be made out by the Clerk of the Company and sealed with

<p class="mt-08em">that the Entertainment shall continue no longer than twelve of the clock when

<p>28th August, 1741. The Court having taken into consideration the ill behaviour
and abusive language of John Atkinson Distiller in White Chappell (a Liveryman of this
Company) on the last day of Election, who in a most gross manner (in the Common Hall
of this Company) the Master of the said Company did greatly insult and abuse and did
otherwise very indecently and rudely behave to other Members of the Company whereby
the Peace of the said Company then assembled was greatly disturbed, and being
determined to put a stop to and prevent the like grievances for the future by punishing all
such offendors herein <span class="smcap">Ordered</span> that the said John Atkinson be fined for such his ill
behaviour to the Master the sum of 6<sup>s</sup> 8<sup>d</sup> and 10<sup>s</sup> for bringing in to Dinner on that day
another person with him after having been acquainted by the Master that the same was
contrary to the By laws of the said Company.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="466"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a></span></p>

<p>1745. It is noticeable that the Potation Money fell off on the
separation of the Surgeons from the Barbers. During the three or
four preceding years the amount had been steadily running down from
an average of £105 to £57, and there seems to have been no Election
or Livery Dinners this year, though the gallant Barbers did not forget
the Ladies, for they gave them (and themselves) a dinner at a cost
of £52 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The Barbers, too, at this time do not seem to have drunk quite
so much wine as the Barber-Surgeons did, and in the year 1747 is the
first mention of Beer, when 12<i>s.</i> was paid for a barrel of small Beer for
the Lord Mayor’s feast, and only 68 bottles of wine were consumed on
this occasion.</p>

<p>Between the years 1750 and 1786 no records are kept of any
but the Mayor’s feasts, though doubtless the Company did not fast
during the intervals.</p>

<p>There is now a striking similarity in these dinner accounts year
by year; usually there were six stewards each of whom provided, about
the years 1775, and later on, no less than 53 bottles of wine each, thus
emulating their predecessors the Barber-Surgeons; there are numerous
references to these bottles as being quarts, so that about 80 gallons
must have been drunk at each dinner. Happily, all this is now changed.</p>

<p>It is noticeable from the earliest times that the Company
on every occasion of a feast, invariably hired their Pewter dishes and
plates at great cost; it seems strange that this continual outlay should
have been incurred, instead of keeping a stock of pewter.</p>

<p>1830 and 1831. Considerable difficulty had arisen for some
years past in procuring Stewards for the Mayor’s feasts, and also in
enforcing the fines for not serving, whereupon a resolution was passed<span class="pagenum" title="467"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a></span>
that Liverymen refusing to pay the Steward’s fine would not be invited
to the dinners, and would be declared ineligible to come on the Court.</p>

<p>The Court seem to have had grave doubts as to the efficacy of
their By-Laws in recovering at law the Steward’s fines, and a case
having been prepared it was submitted to Sir James Scarlett and to Sir
Thomas Denman (the Attorney General). The opinion of the former
eminent Counsel, dated 10th October, 1832, is set out in the minutes,
and he appears to have been very clear that they would not be recoverable,
whereupon the Court ordered a letter (of 16th October) to be
addressed to the Livery, informing them of the difficulty which had
arisen by reason of Liverymen refusing to serve as Stewards in their
rotation (after having partaken of the hospitality of other Stewards in
former years), and that in consequence thereof there would be no dinner
that year. The day after this letter was sent out, Sir Thomas Denman’s
opinion was handed in, and was to the opposite effect of that given by
Sir James Scarlett! Since this period, and now, the Steward’s fine is
paid on the admission of a Liveryman, and thus a source of constant
annoyance is done away with.</p>

<h2>THE IRISH ESTATE.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="dropcap" src="images/cap_t.jpg" width="90" height="98" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">The</span> history of the acquisition by the Corporation of
London and the City Guilds, of their estates in
Ireland has been often related, and full accounts will
be found in “Malcolm’s Londinium Redivivum,”
“Herbert’s Livery Companies,” “Nicholl’s Ironmongers’
Company,” and other works; I shall,
therefore, only treat of the subject so far as the Barber-Surgeons
were concerned.</p>

<p>In 1609 when James I floated his Irish scheme, our Company
seems to have been very loath to enter into it, as would appear by the
insignificant subscriptions proffered by the Members (<i>see</i> page <a href="#Page_473">473</a>).</p>

<p>The difficulty which the Court foresaw in raising the £100
demanded in July, 1609, was endeavoured to be surmounted by the following
ingenious proposition: there had been some previous forced loans to
the King amounting to £123, for which the Company held the City’s
bond, and as this was considered a doubtful asset, it was suggested that
£100 thereof should be adventured on behalf of the Company; it is
needless to say that this innocent suggestion was scouted, and a
peremptory precept for the £100 delivered, whereupon the Court<span class="pagenum" title="469"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a></span>
assessed the various members of the Company and with the greatest
difficulty £30 was thus raised and a further sum of £90 later on. The
Minutes referring to these transactions are especially worthy the
perusal of those persons who claim the estates of the City Companies
as being the “property of the people,” or as having been “left for the
poor,” &amp;c. We see by them that (in our Company certainly, and as
doubtless an examination of records would show, in all other
Companies) the purchase of these lands in Ireland was not only
compulsory, but that it was made from moneys contributed by
individual members for the most part, and the balance from the “Stock
of the house,” this “Stock” being the floating funds in the Renter
Warden’s hands, derived from admissions, fines, &amp;c. We thus see that
no “trust” money was used for the purchase, and that the estates are
saddled with no trust whatever, but are held free, and by an infinitely
better title as far as morality goes, to say nothing of legality, than
many Estates in the hands of some of the aristocratic patrons of the
busybodies bent on spoliation.</p>

<p>In January, 1611, the Company were commanded by precept to
elect whether they would for their contribution accept a tract of land in
Ulster, <i>saddled with a condition to build upon it</i>, or refer the letting of
it to the Irish Society, whereupon they chose the latter, and in July
following came a precept, for its morality worthy of the Land League,
for it called upon the Wardens to pay down £60 more, or else <i>to
absolutely lose the £120 already contributed</i>!</p>

<p>The doleful answer of the Court, dated 19th July, 1611, is
deeply interesting, and we cannot but be touched by the wrongs under
which they suffered, and which constrained them to write:&mdash;“we must
be forced (yf there be lawfull authoritie to take awaye &amp; compell o<sup>r</sup>
Company) to loose the moneys we have alreadye disburssed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="470"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a></span></p>

<p>James, however, did not care much about the money the
Company proposed to abandon; what he required was a further supply,
and the proceedings thereupon are indicated by the Minute of 16th
November, 1611. Shortly after, the Company wisely applied to
“M<sup>r</sup> Recorder” to construe the answer, but even his skill and interest
did not avail, for on 2nd July, 1612, it was agreed that the Master and
Wardens should go before the Court of Aldermen, and “stand hardlie”
against paying any more money, especially as they had not any security
for what had been already advanced, and if committed, they were to go
to prison, rather than pay the £30 demanded, with a proviso that
directly they were imprisoned, the £30 was to be paid, and it was
eventually paid.</p>

<p>In 1613, the Company made over their interest in the Irish
Estate to one of the Wardens, Mr. Allen, but this arrangement was
subsequently annulled.</p>

<p>Many more were the precepts, and the troubles in which the
Company were involved, about this business, but it is satisfactory to
record that in 1623 £11 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was received on account of rents, and
in 1625 a further sum of £10 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The Company were, and are still, associated in their Irish
Estates with the Ironmongers’, Brewers’, Scriveners’, Coopers’,
Pewterers’, and Carpenters’ Companies; but by far the largest
proportion appertains to the Ironmongers, who have always managed
the property.</p>

<p>In 1635, the Attorney General exhibited a Bill in the Star
Chamber against all of the Companies to the intent that they should
surrender up all their rights and evidences touching the Irish plantation,
and on our Company taking Counsel’s opinion, they were advised to
submit to this monstrous piece of injustice. Judgment was given in<span class="pagenum" title="471"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"></a></span>
1637, and the Irish property of all the Companies was seized into the
King’s hands. One would have thought that this flagitious iniquity
might have ended here, but by the decree of the Star Chamber, the
Citizens, in addition to the loss of their Estates, were fined £8,000 to
the King, and on the 8th November, 1638, our unhappy predecessors
were assessed at, and had to pay £64 on this account, the Ironmongers
paying £272, and other Companies according to their settled
proportions.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these high-handed proceedings, the Barber-Surgeons,
ever ready to aid those in distress, voluntarily gave in
1642, what to them in those dire days of taxation was a munificent
gift, namely £20, towards the relief of the poor Protestants in the
north of Ireland, and they further raised, under compulsion, by the
sale of their plate and the mortgage of their property, £400, which
was “<i>lent</i> for the Relief of Ireland upon the faith and order of
Parliament,” and not one penny of which was ever refunded!</p>

<p>The illegal seizures of the Irish lands in 1637 were set aside
by Charles II, who, by his Charter, 10th April, 1662, restored and
confirmed to the citizens all their former privileges and their possessions
in Ireland, and thus our Company became repossessed of
its original property there.</p>

<p>A little previous to 1840 communications passed between
the Barbers and the Ironmongers’ Companies, in reference to an
appointment which had been made by the latter Company, of
Mr. Oseland as Manager of the associated estate at a salary of
£400 per annum. This appointment seems to have been made
without the knowledge or concurrence of the associated Companies,
and led to some little friction, but it was no doubt a wise step, and
appears, after various protests, to have been finally acquiesced in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="472"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a></span></p>

<p>Our property known as the “Lizard Estate,” was on lease
for lives, the sole surviving life being the then Bishop of Meath,
who was 76 years of age. The Ironmongers, in the natural expectation
of an early reversion to the estate, appointed Mr. Oseland
to look after the Companies’ interests, and from the list of his duties
it would seem that his office was no sinecure. The Bishop dying
in 1840, the lease fell in, and there were various consultations among
the Companies as to the advisability of a partition or a sale, or the
granting of a fresh lease. The Scriveners alone desired a partition,
the others were for keeping on the late under-lessees and tenants
as tenants for a year until a course could be decided upon, and
this was eventually agreed to, the Barbers recording in their books
an expression of their sense of the wise manner in which the
Ironmongers’ Company had managed the business.</p>

<p>One very important point discussed at Ironmongers’ Hall was
that of the waste and dilapidations which had been suffered to
accrue by the late lessee. These were estimated to amount to
£5,000, and there was not the least question as to the right and
power of the Companies to have enforced a claim in this respect,
but they generously decided not even to present it; had the
Companies been “trustees” they would have had no option but
to have enforced their claim.</p>

<p>This action accords with the general liberal administration of
Estates as pursued by the City guilds, and is another evidence (if,
indeed, such evidence were wanting!) of the absence of greed and
of the generous way in which tenants are treated by these bodies.</p>

<p>This Estate is subject to no trust whatever, it was purchased
by the Company out of monies which they collected from individual
members of the Guild, or by the sale of their plate, etc., and for<span class="pagenum" title="473"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a></span>
many years it was unproductive. It is a portion of their private
corporate estate, and no trust or charity suffered by this voluntary
abandonment of a large sum to which they were entitled in lieu of
the re-instatement of the dilapidation. The proceedings are all very
fully set out in the Court Minutes for 1840, 1841, etc.</p>

commanding the Company to furnish £100 and at this Court the same
was considered when it was resolved that the common stock of the
Company should contribute £25 and an assessment be made upon the
members as follows: the Livery 20<i>s.</i>, the Assistants of the Yeomanry
10<i>s.</i>, Freemen 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, Aliens 20<i>s.</i>, and foreign brothers 15<i>s.</i> each, and
by a later order each member of the Court was assessed at 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>22nd November, 1610. Great difficulty having been experienced
in collecting these assessments, an order was made that any person
neglecting to pay, should be forthwith dismissed out of the Livery or
Court as the case might be.</p>

<p>18th January, 1611. A precept from the Lord Mayor having
been read and debated, the following answer to the same was ordered

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">There</span> is amongst the Records a small folio volume
which opens with an undated inventory of the
Company’s effects, most probably taken in 1710.
Following are inventories spreading over thirty-three
years until 1745.</p>

<p>There is much similarity in all of these, and we shall take one
of them, that for the year 1728, as an example.</p>

<p>In 1711 there seem to have been two corporate seals, one of
steel and another of silver; there was also “a mould with the Company’s
arms by w<sup>ch</sup> the Iron Backs were made”; this handsome mould is
still preserved over the chimney-piece in the entrance lobby, and an
old “iron back” cast from it is built into the wall of the courtyard
opposite the entrance door.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">The</span> Barber-Surgeons’ Company has at various periods
in its history possessed large quantities of plate, a
great deal of which is now unfortunately lost to us,
most of it having been parted with during the
troublous times of the seventeenth century, when
the money demands made upon the Company
necessitated its sale. We have however, been fortunate in preserving
some very distinctive and beautiful plate, among which are no less
than three Royal gifts from Sovereigns of England, viz., Henry VIII,
Charles II, and Anne.</p>

<p>Throughout our Minutes are numerous references to gifts and
purchases of plate; some of these will be found elsewhere in this work,
and the following extracts in particular referring to this subject, are
additional examples.</p>

<p>2nd January, 1635. Mr. Robert Allott, Doctor in Phisick of

<p>1636. The Company having spent large sums of money in the
erection of the Theatre, and being short of cash, an order was made to
sell the whole of the Yeomanry’s Plate, excepting a beer bowl the gift
of Mr. James Kent.</p>

<p>1637. It having come to the knowledge of the Court that Mr.
Alexander Baker (Master 1622) had bequeathed to the Company a cup
and cover which was withheld by his executors, a suit was commenced
against them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>19th May, 1637. This daye was presented to this Court by a suite &amp; decree
made in his Ma<sup>t</sup>ꝭ Court of Requestꝭ one standing Cupp and Cover gilt of M<sup>r</sup> Alexander

was sould cometh to in toto 129<sup>li</sup> 07<sup>s</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> sale is by this Court confirmed &amp; ordered y<sup>t</sup> that
money received shall be imployed towardꝭ the buildingꝭ now in hand.</p>

<p>31st October, 1642. Whereas heretofore by Order of the Lords &amp; Com̃ons in
Parliament assembled Our Company was proporc͠oned to pay and lend 800<sup>li</sup> at 8<sup>li</sup> pˀ cent
towards and for nothing else than the releife of Ireland. Upon which our Company did
humbly certifie the Lord Maior of the Citty of our inability to pay any part of the said
800<sup>li</sup> Yet for that the present occasions forceing for presente Releife It was Ordered
That 400<sup>li</sup> should be taken up at Interest and payd over into the Chamber of London for
that and noe other purpose. And that now the Company would take up such a quantity
of money but cannott obteyne soe much, It is now ordered That the Kings Cupp and
Cover shalbe kept, And that the Ma<sup>s</sup> &amp; Wardens shall take out all our plate and view it
and see which of it is fitt to be sold and that every parcell of that plate which shalbe sold
a patterne or fashion of it shalbe drawne in paper and the perticuler Letters Writeings or
Graveings shall likewise be written on that paper. To the intent that when the said
ffoure Hundred Pounds with the Interest at 8<sup>li</sup> p. centum shalbe repayd the said Plate
shalbe made againe in the same ffashions &amp; writeings upon them as now they are which
this Court doth order shall fully and really be performed accordingly when the said 400<sup>li</sup>
and Interest shalbe repayd.</p></div>

<p>The following entry is curious from the fact of a blank having
been no doubt purposely left in the Minutes. The Company, who
had been already plucked by the Parliament, evidently feared violence
in that quarter, but were afraid to put it on record, and therefore very
prudently left a hiatus in the Minutes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>24th May, 1643. Whereas this Company is assessed at 8<sup>li</sup> pˀ weeke for 3 moneths
which they are noe wayes able to pay In regard wee are soe much in debt and that the
Hall may be preserved from violence of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is now Ordered That the
plate in the Hall that is not guilt plate shalbe by the M<sup>r</sup> and Wardens delivered over at
the best rate to deliver soe much amounting to 96<sup>li.</sup></p></div>

<p>By the Wardens’ Accounts it appears that plate was sold to the
extent of £94 16<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i></p>

<p>29th April, 1645. On reference to <a href="#Page_140">p.&nbsp;140</a>, it will be seen that
no less than 1,120&nbsp;oz. of plate was pawned to M<sup>rs</sup> Crosse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="497"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>29th April, 1646. The M<sup>r</sup> &amp; Wardens acquainting this Court That the
Companye’s plate is redeemed from M<sup>r</sup> Steele at his request who married M<sup>rs</sup> Crosse to
whome it was formerly pawned in her Widowhood and is now in the Treasury. This
Court doth think it not convenient to be kept in the <span class="nowrap">house<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> and doth order that it be

</p></div>

<p>14th May, 1646. The plate was pawned to Mr. John Browne
for £300 at 6 per cent.</p>

<p>29th April, 1647. It was ordered that it should be redeemed,
and it was on the 17th May following all brought back to the Hall.</p>

<p>7th December, 1648. The plate was again pawned to Mr. John
Browne, of Westminster, for £250.</p>

<p>19th March, 1649. The Court were so severely pressed by
Assessments for the Army, and being unable to borrow any more
money under the Company’s seal, resolved after much deliberation to
absolutely sell Plate to the value of £300.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">19th July, 1649. Our M<sup>r</sup> acquainted This Court That
upon sale of the Companyes Plate M<sup>r</sup> Edward Arris bought
King Henry the Eighths Cup and Cover and hath freely given
it againe to this Company.</span></p>

<p>1890. The following plate is now in the Company’s possession:</p>

<p>A handsome standing silver gilt Grace cup and Cover (<span class="nowrap">26 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&nbsp;ozs.)
presented by King Henry VIII in 1540 in commemoration of the
union of the Barbers with the Surgeons. This cup is elaborately
chased and enriched with badges of the Tudor Rose, Portcullis, and
Fleur-de-lys; the cover is surmounted with the Crown Imperial under<span class="pagenum" title="498"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a></span>
which are the arms of France and England quarterly, with the lyon and
greyhound as supporters. There are four bells pendant from the cup<span class="pagenum" title="499"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a></span>
which are referred to by Pepys as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">Among other observables at Chyrurgeon’s Hall we drunk the King’s health out of
a gilt cup, given by King Henry viij., to the Company, with bells hanging at it, which
every man is to ring by shaking after he hath drunk up the whole cup.&mdash;<i>Diary,
27th February, 1662–3.</i></p></div>

<img src="images/img075.jpg" width="380" height="589" alt="" />
<div><p class="ti0em tac fs85">GRACE CUP.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>This cup although it has been stolen, pawned and sold, yet
remains to us, one of the most precious relics of our past. It appears
by the Wardens’ Accounts, that in 1669 John Knight, Serjeant-Surgeon,
who was Master, had the cup repaired and a case made for
it; Serjeant Knight was again Master 1677–8, when he caused a plate
to be fixed within the cover with this <span class="nowrap">inscription&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-08em">Henrici R. Munificentia Ne Posteris Ignota Maneat Johannis Knight R.C.P<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span> 1678.</p>
</div>

<p>In the bowl of the Cup is an outline engraving of the old coat of
the Barbers, impaling the cognizance of the Surgeons in one shield
(<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_435">p.&nbsp;435</a>).</p>

<p>King Charles II in 1676 presented us with a very handsome
and unique parcel gilt standing cup and cover, surmounted by the
crown imperial, and having within the same the Royal arms, supporters
and crown (68 ozs.). This Cup is known as “The Royal Oak Cup”
(commemorative of the King’s escape at Boscobel), its stem and base
representing the trunk and roots of an oak tree; the bowl or upper part
is surrounded with oak leaves, branches, wreaths of flowers, escallop
shells, and pendant acorns as bells from shields. The Company’s arms
are engraved on one shield, on another the crest, on the third is the
following inscription:&mdash;“Donum Munificentissimi Regis Caroli Secundi
Anno 1676,” and on the last shield&mdash;“Impetrantibus Chirurgis Regiis
<span class="pagenum" title="500"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a></span>Johanne Knight Chirurgo Regis Principali et Jacobo Pearse Eodem

<p>This James Pearse, surgeon to the King and the Duke of York,
was Master in 1675, and his wife will be well remembered as one of
Samuel Pepys’ friends and gossips.</p>

<p>Queen Anne in 1704 presented the Company with a fine and
massive punch bowl (160&nbsp;ozs.) bearing this <span class="nowrap">inscription:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>2nd. Thomas Bowden’s cup (38 ozs.). He was third Warden
1654. On one side is engraved a shield quarterly, with a lyon passant
on the first quarter only. The motto of the Company is misspelt thus,
“de Pricipiencia dei,” and the cup bears this inscription, “Ex dono

<p>3rd. Sir John Frederick’s cup (38&nbsp;ozs. 10 dwt.). He was

<p>Another antique punch ladle of oval shape, with hard wood

probably about 1620.</p>

<p>A massive silver badge <span class="nowrap">7 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&#8201;-in. by <span class="nowrap">8 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>&#8201;-in. of late 17th Century

<p>A very handsome badge, 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches diameter, of silver gilt
open work, and richly enamelled with the arms of the Company, and
a loop representing the Tudor rose crowned. This badge is worn by
the Master.</p>

<p>A pair of antique Beadle’s mace heads. These are of remarkably
fine workmanship, very massive, and have the Company’s heraldry

(<i>See illustration <a href="#Page_302">p.&nbsp;302</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>Four very handsomely chased and wrought silver garlands
or wreaths for crowning the Master and Wardens on Election Day,
and which are still used and worn by them on Court days in receiving
guests. These are the finest in the City of London; each has the
Company’s arms and the badges of the rose and crown, with other
devices artistically set forth, and are mounted with silk velvet, the
Renter Warden’s being green, and the others red. These garlands
were made in 1629. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_494">p.&nbsp;494</a>.)</p>

Worshipful Company of Barbers 1790.”</p>

<p>A silver mounted snuff box, and another snuff box presented
by Mr. Deputy Brass and handsomely carved out of a piece of
oak removed from the roof of the old Hall. This is enclosed in
another box velvet lined, with inscription on a silver <span class="nowrap">plate&mdash;</span></p>

The Barbers Company have well deserved<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="smcap">The</span> following are some extracts from the Minutes,
relating to Pictures.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>24th June, 1601. It is this daye by consent of a wholl
Courte of Assistance ordered That if at any tyme hereafter any
M<sup>r</sup> or Governor of this company or any oth<sup>r</sup> pˀsone or pˀsones free
of the same mistery shall blott deface or put oute or cause to be
blotted defaced or put oute any of the pictures of any of this Company nowe paynted or
hereafter lawfully placed in any of the tables of pictures hangeinge in the Com̃on hall of
this mistery w<sup>th</sup>out the Consent of a full Courte of Assistance That then hee or they so
offendinge shall forfeyte and paye for every such offence x<sup>li</sup> the one half thereof to be to
the use of the Chamberlen of the Cytie of London And the oth<sup>r</sup> half to the use of the
said mistery.</p></div>

<p>The above order was made in consequence of some members
of the Court having painted out the faces on the pictures, and caused
their own to be depicted in their stead.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>28th June, 1604. This daye it is ordered that M<sup>r</sup> Will<sup>m</sup> Martin M<sup>r</sup> ffrederick
M<sup>r</sup> ffyneinge &amp; M<sup>r</sup> ffenton shall pˀsently conferre with Decreete concerninge the
ffynisheinge of the tables of Picktures remayneinge w<sup>th</sup> him and if hee will finishe the
same w<sup>th</sup> reason and drawe them to the Hall they are to compound w<sup>th</sup> him for the same
if not the table is to be taken awaye from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="509"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"></a></span></p>

<p>10th October, 1605. This day it is ordered that the Kingꝭ picture shalbe by
the said pˀnte M<sup>rs</sup> boughte and pˀvided at the charge of this house.</p>


<div class="center">

<p>1st August, 1634. It is ordered that the 41 philosophers pictures shalbe
rebeautified and repaired by M<sup>r</sup> Greeneburye at the Costs of this house soe it exceede
not x<sup>li.</sup></p>
</div>

<p>The “forty-one philosophers” were former Masters of Anatomy
and Examiners of Surgeons, who as they were from time to time
appointed, might if they chose, have their portraits put in what was
called “The Table of the Anatomy” (and which was, I think, one large
picture containing the effigies of forty-one persons), and the practice
undoubtedly was, as occasion arose, to paint a face on old shoulders;
indeed, there are many notices to this effect, as also orders of Court for
blotting out the “faces” of such as had become obnoxious, or who had
been removed for misconduct.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1st February, 1627. Item this daye upon the moc͠on of our M<sup>r</sup> it is ordered by
this Court that there shalbe a large wainscott frame made and a picture maker shalbe
agreed withall by the present M<sup>rs</sup> for the portreying of the Anathomye and makeing of
M<sup>r</sup> Docto<sup>r</sup> Gwins picture and the Clarkes which Charge shalbe borne out of the stock of
this house, in which table shalbe placed the figures &amp; visages of every of the Assistants
whoe are not painted in the Anathomye table that now standeth upp in the Hall, every
of the Assistants payeing for the setting up of his owne picture.</p>

<p>29th March, 1647. This Court doth order That M<sup>r</sup> Henry Watsons ffigure in
the present Table of Anatomy be blotted out and M<sup>r</sup> Charleyes Effigies placed in the
roome thereof Provided that his Executrix pay his Legacy to this House.</p>

<p>This Court doth order That there be a new Anathomy Table And that all the
Assistants whose Effigies are not in the present Table may be sett up in the new Table
at theire owne charge, and that Doctor Goddards ffigure be there sett as Reader and Doctor
Prudions Effigies may be painted there if he desireth it And this Court doth order that
M<sup>r</sup> Watson a Brother of this Company shall make the said Table and paint thereon the
ffigure of an Anathomy with the severall ffigures of the said Reader Doctor Prudion and<span class="pagenum" title="510"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510"></a></span>
our Clarke at the charge of this House And that the ffigures of the present M<sup>rs</sup> of
Anatomy be there sett as Dissectors at theire owne charge.</p>

<p>9th August, 1647. This Court takeing into considerac͠oon the greate benefitt and
proffitt That have accrewed to this House by M<sup>r</sup> Edward Arris a loveing Brother of this
Company This Court doth order That his picture be sett up in the Blanck Table in the
Hall next the Anathomy Table at the charge of this Howse.</p>

<p>19th August, 1647. Upon the earnest request of Mr. Edward Arris to this Court
That his Picture be nott sett up in the Hall according to the Order of the last Court of
Assistants This Court to satisfy Mr. Arris modest request therein doth order that that
order be annulled and not put in execuc͠on.</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding this order Mr. Arris’ portrait was painted, and
is still at the Hall.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>27th February, 1650. M<sup>r</sup> Arris and Doctor Scarboroughs pictures to be sett in
the void Table in the Hall at the charge of this House.</p></div>

<p>In 1720 the Court were possibly thinking of purchasing another
Holbein, as the following note occurs in the minutes,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3rd March, 1720. Memorand<sup>m</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Lenthall at Burford in Oxfordshire has a
Picture of S<sup>r</sup> Thomas More and his familey drawn by Hans Holben being a dispute
between his Protestant Daughter and his Catholick Daughter in the pˀsence of the father
and the rest of the familey.</p>

<p>21st April, 1720. It is referred to the Governors to treat with M<sup>r</sup> Vertue the
Ingraver about Ingraving King Henry the Eighths Picture and to report his proposall to a
Court of Assistants.</p></div>

<p>27th August, 1734. The question of engraving the Picture was
again referred to a Committee.</p>

<p>17th September, 1734. The Committee reported, the result
being that Mr. Bernard Baron entered into an agreement to engrave a
plate; the details of the arrangements with him are all set out in the
minutes, but are not sufficiently interesting to warrant transcribing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="511"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"></a></span></p>

<p>Baron’s engraving is well known and sought after by collectors,
but it has a peculiarity, being a complete reverse of the original
picture. Each Assistant is presented with a copy on his election on to
the Court.</p>

<p>We formerly had a portrait of Dr. Tyson, Anatomy Reader, but
this was sold to one of his descendants in 1745 for ten guineas.</p>

<p>10th November, 1777. Mr. William Slade, an Assistant,
presented a mezzotint engraving of the portrait of John Paterson, Esq.,
formerly Clerk of the Company; the original was painted by Sir
Joshua Reynolds. This engraving is now hung in the committee room.</p>

<p>The following is but little more than a List of the Pictures now
at Barbers’ Hall, a full account of which has been already written by
Mr. C.&nbsp;J. Shoppee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linneus’ Picture.</span> This picture of Linneus was purchased 2nd
July, 1844, for £3 3<i>s.</i>, the particulars of the purchase and of the picture
are set out in the Court Minutes of this date. Mr. Shoppee has
surmised that this is a portrait of John Bancks, but though his portrait
was <i>ordered</i> to be painted, I do not find that it ever was, and it is not
once mentioned in any of the numerous early inventories of pictures.
The Minutes of 1844 are, however, so precise as to leave no further
doubt on this point, viz., that it is a portrait of Linneus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Holbein Picture.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">King Charles II Picture</span>, artist unknown. Purchased by the
Company 1720–1721.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inigo Jones’ Picture</span>, by Sir A. Vandyke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Lisle’s Picture</span>, artist unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Frederick’s Picture</span>, artist unknown. Purchased by
the Company, 1665–1666.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serjeant-Surgeon Charles Bernard’s Picture.</span> This picture
was painted by Mr. Murray in 1711, the Company paying him £12 10<i>s.</i>
for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Duchess of Richmond’s Picture</span>, by Sir Peter Lely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="513"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Johnson’s Picture</span>, artist unknown. Mr. Johnson was
Master 1677; he has been erroneously described as “Serjeant
Surgeon” and “Serjeant Knight,” but never held the first office, and
there is no such dignity as “Serjeant Knight.” The fact is that Mr.
Johnson dying in his year of Master, was succeeded by John Knight,
Serjeant Surgeon (commonly called “Serjeant Knight”) and Mr.
Knight’s name being so written under Mr. Johnson’s in an old list
of Masters, has been taken as the title of an office!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ephraim Skinner’s Picture</span>, artist unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernard Baron’s</span> red crayon study of Holbein’s picture.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Two Spanish Pictures.</span>” These were so called in the old
Inventories. There was also in the Inventory of 1720 “A picture of
the Prince Elector Palatine,” but this subsequently disappeared, though
the “Spanish pictures” remained in the Inventories for many years.
Mr. Shoppee suggests that they are the portraits of Frederick Casimir
and his wife Elizabeth. At the top of one of them is a shield of arms,
being the coat of Byrkes or Brykes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen Anne’s Picture</span>, artist unknown.</p>

<p>All the foregoing Pictures are hung in the Court Room. In the
Committee Room are various pictures, engravings and portraits of
recent Masters.</p>

<p>In the Vestibule to the Court Room is an ancient list of Masters
and Wardens on Vellum, enclosed with oak folding doors. It is not,
however, very accurate. It was at the Hall in 1720, and probably for
many years previously. The list was rewritten over the old lettering in
1865. (<i>See head piece, <a href="#Page_1">p.&nbsp;1</a>.</i>)</p>

of the Barber-Surgeons on the 26th August, 1584. In 1586 he was
one of the Commissioners appointed to try Mary Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>For striking the Earl of Oxford in the Chamber of Presence, he
was put under arrest, but managed shortly after to obtain a pardon
and his freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="515"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"></a></span></p>

<p>He married Frances, daughter of Thomas Earl of Rutland, by
whom he left at his decease, 10th February, 1557, an only daughter
Elizabeth (the wife of Sir Thomas Fane), who was subsequently
created Baroness le Despencer.</p>

o<sup>r</sup> M<sup>r</sup> received into the Clothing or livery of this Companie and had a livery hood layed
upon his lo<sup>ps</sup> shoulder.</p></div>

<p>Lord Windsor at one time resided in Monkwell Street, close to
the Hall; he was chosen a Knight of the Bath 1610, at the creation of
Henry, Prince of Wales. He was subsequently Rear-Admiral of the
Fleet sent by James I to bring Prince Charles out of Spain, and on
that occasion entertained on board ship the Grandees of the Court of
Spain with princely magnificence. His Lordship married Lady
Katherine Somerset daughter of Edward, fourth Earl of Worcester,
K.G., but dying without issue on the 6th June, 1642, he was succeeded
by his nephew Thomas Windsor-Hickman, the son of his elder sister
Elizabeth.</p>


<h3>THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH, K.G.</h3>

<p>James Scott, the natural son of Charles II, was born 9th April,
1649, and created Duke of Monmouth in 1663. The same year, on
the 7th May, he was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons,
in company with Alexander Lord Leven, Richard Hopton, and
Thomas Rosse, Esquires.</p>

<p>The history of this unfortunate man is well known, and culminated
in his being beheaded on the 15th July, 1685.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="516"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"></a></span></p>


<h3>ALEXANDER, SECOND EARL OF LEVEN.</h3>

<p>This nobleman was the grandson of the celebrated General
Sir Alexander Leslie, First Earl of Leven, whom he succeeded in
1662. On the 7th May, 1663, he was admitted to the freedom of the
Barber-Surgeons, in company with the Duke of Monmouth.</p>

<p>He married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Howard, and
sister of the Earl of Carlisle, but died without issue male, in 1663.
His kinsman George, fourth Lord Melville, was a staunch adherent
of the Duke of Monmouth, and involved in the rebellion, but was
lucky enough to escape into Holland; he was, however, attainted
and his estates forfeited in 1685, but coming back to England with
William III his estates and dignity were restored to him.</p>


<h3>SIR JOHN AYLEF.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img083.jpg" width="165" height="192" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">Sir John Aylef</span> was an eminent Surgeon
and probably born about 1490. Diligent
search has been made for his parentage, but
without success. In his will he refers to
seven “poor” people “being of my kynn
dwelling in Grenewiche,” and from the fact
that he had a grant of arms instead of inheriting
a paternal coat, as also the silence
of his immediate descendants when registering
the pedigrees at the Heralds’ Visitations
(who must have known but did not care to register Sir John’s father),
it may be assumed that he was of humble origin.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the freedom of the Barbers prior to 1522
and served the office of Warden 1530, 1532 and 1535, being chosen
Master 1538. At this time he was Surgeon to Henry VIII and had<span class="pagenum" title="517"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a></span>
cured him of a fistula, for which the king granted him the manor
of Gryttenham in Wiltshire, part of the lands of the Abbey of
Malmesbury. Henry also bequeathed by his will 100 marks to Aylef.</p>

<p>Mr. Aylef, being elected on 1st August, 1548, served the office
of Sheriff 1548–9, and in Wriothesley’s Chronicle under date 1549

<p class="ti0em tac"><i>From the original painting by</i> <span class="smcap">Holbein,<br />at Barber’s Hall</span>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two days afterwards Sir John had a grant of arms from Sir
Thomas Hawley, Clarencieux, and shortly after was elected Alderman
of Dowgate Ward. He seems to have relinquished his profession of
a Surgeon and to have become a Merchant, holding the important
office of Master of Blackwell Hall, one of the greatest commercial
centres of the period, and residing at the Hall, in the parish of
St. Michael Bassishaw.</p>

<p>On the 28th May, 1550, he was chosen the first Alderman of
the newly-created ward of Bridge Without, some interesting particulars
of which may be seen in Stow’s Survey (ed. 1633, p.&nbsp;446); while in
Wriothesley’s Chronicle, under date 1550, we also <span class="nowrap">read&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ti0em mt-08em">Memorandum. Wednesday in the Whitson weeke, at a Court of the Aldermen kept
in the Guyldhall, Sir John Aliffe, Knight, and master of Blackwell Hall, was sworne
an alderman of the Bridg ward without, and to have the jurisdiction of the Borough of
Southwark, and 2 deputies to be appointed there to assist him, which was the first
alderman that ever was there, which was done by the advise of my Lord Mayor and
thˀ Aldermen, for the better order to be kept there, and for the more quietnes of the
Mayors hereafter to come, and the good order of the Kinges subjectes there, accordinge<span class="pagenum" title="518"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518"></a></span>

of the borough at the bridg-house, to whom he shewed theyr alderman, and appointed
deputies under him, and so hereafter to see a good order to be kept in the Borough,
as in other wardes of the citye of London.</p></div>

<p>Sir John subsequently removed to his old ward of Dowgate
(and continued Alderman there till his death, his successor being
chosen 12th November, 1556). After his election as Alderman he was
translated to the Grocers’ Company, of which ancient guild he was
crowned Upper Warden, 9th June, 1556, in view of his election as
Lord Mayor for which he stood next in nomination, and to which
office, had he lived but a few weeks longer, he would in all probability
have been chosen. He was married to Isabel Buckell of Warwickshire,
and by her had four children, John, Erkynwald, Mary and Alice. His
son John and great grandson George, were both knighted. His widow,
Dame Isabel, had a grant of arms by Thomas Hawley (3 &amp; 4 Ph. &amp; M.)
ar. a fesse vaire or and az. betw. three doves ppr. bearing in their
beaks a branch gu. Sir John Aylef’s funeral is thus recorded in

<p class="ti0em tac"><i>From the original painting by</i> <span class="smcap">Holbein,<br />at Barber’s Hall</span>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thomas Vicary was probably born between 1490 and 1500,
and is stated in Manningham’s Diary to have been “at first a meane
practiser in Maidstone untill the King advanced him for curing his
sore legge.” In 1525 he was third Warden of the Barbers’ Company,
and in 1528 Upper Warden and one of the Surgeons of Henry VIII
with £20 a year. In 1530 he was Master of the Company and
appointed Serjeant-Surgeon, which latter office he held until his death.
In 1539 Henry granted him a beneficial lease for 21 years of the
Rectory and tithes of the dissolved Abbey of Boxley in Kent. In
1541 Vicary was chosen Master of the Barber-Surgeons, to which
office he was again elected in 1546, 1548, and 1557 having thus
held the chief place in the Company no less than five times&mdash;an honour
to which no other member has ever attained. In the Holbein picture
Vicary is represented as receiving the Charter from the King. In
1542 he and his son William were appointed by the King Bailiffs of
the Manor of Boxley, and five years later he married his second wife,
Alice Bucke. In 1548 Vicary was appointed a Governor of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, and soon afterwards became the Resident Surgical
Governor there; in June, 1552, he was made “one of the assistants of
this house (St. Bartholomew’s) for the terme of his lyffe.” In 1548 he
published his celebrated book “The Anatomie of the bodie of man,”
no copy of the first edition of which is now known to be extant.
On the 27th January, 1561, Vicary made his will, which was
proved in London 7th April, 1562. The will, which is set out in full
in Dr. Furnivall’s book, is too long to give here <i>in extenso</i>, but the
following extracts will be found of interest.</p>

<h3>RICHARD FERRIS, <span class="smcap">Serjeant-Surgeon</span>.</h3>

<p>But little is known of Richard Ferris, though he was doubtless
a man of repute, as Gale speaks approvingly of him, and he held the
office of Serjeant-Surgeon in Queen Elizabeth’s time; his portrait is
preserved by Holbein in our great picture, and Henry VIII, by his
will, bequeathed him 100 marks. He was twice Master of the
Barber-Surgeons, viz., in 1551 and 1562.</p>

<p>His will, dated 17th March, 1566, was proved on the 22nd
April, 1566, wherein he describes himself as “Richard Ferres Serjant
Surgion unto the quenes majestie, sick of bodie.” He gives to “Em,”
his wife, his house, field, and orchard at Paddington for her life, with
remainder to his daughter Thomazine, and to her also the lease of the
house where he then dwelt in St. Giles, Cripplegate. In the event of
their deaths without issue, the property to be sold and distributed
amongst the poor in the discretion of his overseer, John <span class="nowrap">Field<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span> and
Dr. Gregorie Wisdom, except 40<i>s.</i> to his cousin Johanne Sympson.
To his daughter Thomazine his “Courte bedd and bedstede,” also a
feather bed and bedstead furnished, half a garnish of pewter vessels,
&amp;c., and £30 which was owing to him by Dr. Cunningham (Reader at
Barber-Surgeons’ Hall).</p>

<h3>JOHN PEN.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img088.jpg" width="165" height="232" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em">Much time has been spent in the endeavour
to ascertain John Pen’s parentage, but without
success. Among the Domestic State
Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. I (No. 4064) is
the grant of a corrody or sustentation from
the Monastery of Abbotsbury to Robert
Pen “one of the Gentlemen of the Chapel”
and to John Pen, his son, for life. The
date of this document is 9th March, 1514,
and as John Pen was a retainer of the
King’s, which this grant would also seem
to imply, and had a son whom he named
Robert, there is the possibility that this Robert Pen, the Gentleman
of the Chapel, was his father.</p>

<p>John Pen was admitted to the freedom of the Barbers in 1527,
and his birth may probably be put at 1500–1505. He was by profession
a barber, and evidently a friend of King Henry VIII, who advanced
him from Groom of the Privy Chamber to the honorable position of
King’s Barber, an office which was only bestowed upon the most trusty
and confidential of the King’s attendants; the life of the sovereign
being in his barber’s hands. (<i>See</i> pp. 90 and 91.)</p>

<p>Pen served the office of Master in 1539, and his portrait is in
the Holbein picture. He married, about 1530, Lucy, daughter and
heiress of Edmond Chevall of Sissivernes, in Codicote, Herts, and by
her he had a good estate. In 1545 Henry granted him the manor of
Codicote and the demesne lands of the late dissolved Abbey of St.
Alban’s for £826 9<i>s.</i> 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub><i>d.</i>, to hold by the forty-fifth part of a
knight’s fee. The King also bequeathed him 100 marks by his will.
By an Inquisition taken at West Barnet 18th October, 5 &amp; 6<span class="pagenum" title="526"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a></span>
Ph. &amp; M., it was found that John Pen died 21st August, 1558, and
that Thomas, his son and heir, was then of the age of 25 years and
9 months. John Pen’s Will, dated 15th August, 1558, was proved by
his widow on the 6th May, 1559. Coleman in his list of Wills of the
Pen family states that a second grant of Probate was taken of this
Will by Gyles Pen on 10th October, 1560, but this is absolutely
incorrect; on this date the Will of one Gyles Peny of Halstocke in
Dorsetshire was proved, and Mr. Coleman has confounded this in
a remarkable way with John Pen’s Will, with which it has no
connection whatever. That Pen was not, or did not know that he was,
a connection of the Pens of Bucks, is most likely, as he obtained a
grant of arms for himself, in which the combs on either side of
the lion of England are typical of his office of King’s Barber.
These arms were 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> Ar. on a fesse gu. betw. three peacocks
az. a lyon pass. guar. or betw. two combs of the first (Pen) 2<sup>d</sup> &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup>
Or three horses’ heads couped sa. bridled ar. (Cheval).</p>

</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">Robert Balthrop</span> was born in 1522,
and about the year 1538 apprenticed
to Nicholas Alcock (Surgeon to King
Edward VI). He was admitted to the
freedom 3rd March, 1545, and to the Livery
20th October, 1552. He served the office
of Warden in 1560 and 1564, and was
Master of the Company in 1565 and again
in 1573. About the year 1562 he was
appointed Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen
Elizabeth and held that office until his death (9th December, 1591).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="529"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"></a></span></p>

<p>He is buried in the church of St. Bartholomew the Less, where

<p>Balthrop’s will was made about a fortnight before his death (27th
November), and therein he directs his body to be buried in St.
Bartholomew’s the Less, in which parish he then resided. He seems
to have amassed a considerable estate and to have made a rather
lengthy will, but as a great deal of it is of much interest, especially his
inventory of surgical instruments and books, no apology is needed for
quoting largely from it.</p>

<p>Sir Peter’s eldest son, Heneage, was knighted; he was Sheriff
of Bucks, and M.P. for Amersham. His second son, Henry, was
Common Serjeant of London. Sir Peter was the ancestor of several
members of Parliament as also of the Marquess of Rockingham
and the Earl of Carysfort. His grandson Peter Proby, who
married Grace, daughter of Sir Richard Ford, was chosen a
Liveryman of the Company 10th March, 1659.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM CLOWES.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img092.jpg" width="165" height="193" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">William Clowes</span> was the son of Thomas
Clowes, originally of Kingsbury, Warwickshire,
and afterwards of London. He was
born about 1540, and studied surgery under
Mr. George Keble, who was not free of our
Company, but of whom Clowes more than
once speaks in terms of highest praise. He
tells us that in 1563 he served as a Surgeon
in the army under the Earl of Warwick at
Havre, and after this campaign he was for
some time in the Navy, in both which appointments he undoubtedly
gained great experience. In 1569 he no doubt settled in London, as<span class="pagenum" title="536"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536"></a></span>
on the 8th of November in that year he was admitted to the freedom by
translation, and he soon secured a large practice, though it was not
until the 18th July, 1588, that he was made an Assistant of the Court.</p>

<p>The records do not display Mr. Clowes’ character in the most
favourable light, as the following extracts will <span class="nowrap">show:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">6th October, 1573. Here was one &amp; complayned [against] Willm̄ Clowes for
takynge his money and he not cured.</p>

<p>7th February, 1575. Here came one Willm̄ Goodnep and complayned of Willm̄
Clowes for not curing his wief de morbo gallico and yt was awarded that the saide Clowes
sholde either geve the saide Goodnep xx<sup>s</sup> orells cure his saide wief w<sup>ch</sup> Clowes agreed to
pay the xx<sup>s</sup> and so they were agreed and eche of them made acquittance to other.</p>

<p>28th February, 1576. Here was a complainte against Willm̄ Clowes by one
Goodenge for that the saide Clowes had not onlie misused the saide Goodinge in speche
but also most of the masters of the Company w<sup>th</sup> scoffing wordes and jestes, and they all
forgave him here openlye in the Co<sup>r</sup>te and so the stryfe was ended upon condˀ that he
sholde nev<sup>r</sup> so misuse him self agayne and bonds was caused to be made to that effect.</p>

<p>25th March, 1577. Here at this Corte was a greate contension and stryffe
spoken of and ended betwene George Baker and Willm̄ Clowes for that they bothe
contrary to order and the good and holsome rules of this howse misused eche other and
fought in the ffelds togethers. But the M<sup>r</sup> Wardens and assistance wishing that they
might be and continewe loving brothers pˀdoned this greate offence in hope of
amendement.</p></div>

<p>The George Baker with whom Clowes fought, was afterwards
Serjeant-Surgeon and Master of the Company in 1597. In 1575
Mr. Clowes was appointed one of the surgeons of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital and later on he was surgeon to Christ’s Hospital; he was
also surgeon to Queen Elizabeth and James I. His first book, “De
morbo Gallico,” was published in 1579. In 1585 he went as surgeon
of the forces in the expedition to the Low Countries under the Earl<span class="pagenum" title="537"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537"></a></span>
of Leicester. In his book, “Proved Practise,” he tells a great deal of
this expedition and says that many of the surgeons were most unskilful
and “slew more than the enemy did,” though he and his friend
Serjeant-Surgeon Gooderus (Master 1594) did not lose a case. Mr.
Clowes had the honour of serving in the fleet which defeated the
Spanish Armada, and in 1594 was Warden of the Barber-Surgeons,
the last Court which he attended was on the 9th February, 1596.
After a successful practice he retired to a country house at Plaistow,
in Essex, and died in 1604. Dr. Norman Moore says that his books
“are the best surgical writings of the Elizabethan age; they are all
in English, and his style is very easy and forcible, sometimes a little
prolix but never obscure.”</p>


<h3>WILLIAM CLOWES, <span class="smcap">Jun., Serjeant-Surgeon</span>.</h3>

<p>He was the son of William Clowes, Barber-Surgeon; born
about 1582, he was apprenticed to his father and admitted to our
freedom 22nd January, 1605, and on 13th December, 1615, called to
the Livery; he was then surgeon to the Prince of Wales, and had a
dispensation from the Court of the Company to attend the lectures and
Hall only on such occasions as should be convenient to him. On the
accession of Charles I he was made Serjeant-Surgeon to the King. In
1626 he was Master of the Company, and again in 1638. A
characteristic letter of Serjeant Clowes and some particulars as to his
election as Master in 1626 may be seen on pp. 248–250. On 30th
October, 1648, his decease was reported to the Court.</p>

<p>By his will, dated 28th March, 1630, he bequeathed his
property freehold and copyhold, to his wife Sara, his son James,
and his daughters Ann and Sara.</p>

<h3>THOMAS THORNEY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Thorney</span>, born in 1542 or 1543, was apprenticed to
William Bovey (Master 1581) a surgeon in large practice. He was
made free 8th April, 1573, and elected an Assistant 19th June, 1595;
he served as Warden in 1598 and 1600 and was twice Master of the
Company, viz., in 1602 and 1606, he was also a Common Councilman.
Mr. Thorney acquired considerable property in Holborn and the
country, but dying on 4th June, 1614, without issue, made his nephew
Peter (son of his then deceased brother Walter) his heir. He was a
considerable benefactor to the Parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, where
there is a monumental tablet to his memory. His Will dated 25th
May, 1612, was proved on the day of his death, and among other
bequests to St. Andrew’s Holborn, he left £10 to the <span class="nowrap">Churchwardens&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">to make a Dynner or supper therwith and to make merrie therewith with my
good neighboures for my sake and to encrease neighbourelie love amongest them And

love amongest them The said ffyve poundes to be paied to the Master and Wardens
when they come to fetch my bodye to the churche.</p></div>

<p>To his wife Annie he gave his dwelling house in Holborn, and
another newly built house there, also one on the street side next the
Bars, and the third part of all his other lands for her life and all his
goods and movables. To Richard Cade “my auncient and honest
servaunte” and to Jane his wife 40<i>s.</i> each for rings. To his nephew,
Peter Thorney, his houses in Fetter Lane, the Bell Inn at Acton, a
dwelling house at Acton, and the King’s Head in Holborn near the
Bars, with a proviso that should Peter die without heirs the Bell at
Acton was to pass to the Barber-Surgeons.</p>


<h3>PETER THORNEY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Thorney</span> was apprenticed to his uncle Thomas Thorney
and admitted to the freedom 14th July, 1603. He seems to have got
into good practice and was one of the Army Surgeons. He was
appointed Surgeon-General of the Army going to the relief of Rochelle,
and made his will a few days afterwards (25th July, 1628) with a
presentiment of his death, which was soon realised, as probate was
granted on the 24th November following. He <span class="nowrap">says&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">I com̃end my bodie to bee buried where it shall please god or my freindes, if I

Andrews Church as neare to my Unckle M<sup>r</sup> Thomas Thorney as maie bee.</p></div>

<p>Among other bequests he gives five marks to such of the livery

Thomas (then under age) his heir generally and provides for his wife

<h3>JOHN GERARD.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img094.jpg" width="165" height="231" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">John Gerard</span> was born in 1545 at Nantwich
in Cheshire, his parentage is unknown,
though by his coat of arms he appears to
have descended from the Gerards of Ince
in Lancashire. In 1562 he was apprenticed
to Alexander Mason, a Surgeon in extensive
practice, who was Warden in 1556 and 1561
and Master in 1567 and 1573 (Mr. Mason
died 3rd April, 1574). Gerard was admitted
to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons 9th
December, 1569. There is no record of his
admission to the Livery, though in consequence
of his professional attainments and his presumable friendship
with his master who made him free, he doubtless had the clothing at
the same time. The only note we have of Gerard, before he comes
on the Court, is one in which he appears before the Masters as
defendant in a case of alleged slander on the wife of a brother freeman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="541"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>21st February, 1578. Here was a complainte against Jo: Jerrard for saying that
Richard James his wief had the ffrenche pocks, and he made answere and saide he wolde
justifie the same, and he was dismist to the Comon Lawe.</p></div>

<p>Gerard was elected a Member of the Court of Assistants on
the 19th June, 1595. For some long time previous he must have been
engaged in the preparation of his great work “<i>The Herball or Generall
Historie of Plantes</i>,” a folio of some 1,400 pages, embellished with
about 1,800 illustrations of plants<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span> and published in 1597, which, whilst
it was by far the best and most exhaustive work of its kind at that
period, has ever since been considered a standard book of reference;
&nbsp;a good copy being now worth 8 to 10 guineas. At this period he was
living “at my house in Holburne, within the suburbs of London,”
probably near Fetter Lane, where he had a large garden of herbs.</p>

<p>The style of Gerard’s writing was very quaint, and abounds
with quiet humour; he scouted monkish tales and old wives’ fables
concerning the miraculous properties of plants, etc., honestly endeavouring
to present facts to his readers; yet even he has not
hesitated to record as true, and gravely set forth, some fabulous stories,
as, for example, in speaking of Barnacles on p.&nbsp;1391, he <span class="nowrap">says&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="542"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">There is a small Ilande in Lancashire called the Pile of Foulders, wherein are
found the broken peeces of old and brused ships .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wheron is found a certaine spume
or froth, that in time breedeth unto certaine shels, in shape like those of the muskle,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
wherein is conteined a thing in forme like a lace of silke finely woven, as it were togither,
of a whitish colour; one end whereof is fastned unto the inside of the shell;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
other end is made fast unto the belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which in time commeth to
the shape &amp; forme of a Bird: when it is perfectly formed, the shel gapeth open, &amp; the
first thing that appeereth is the foresaid lace or string; next come the legs of the Birde
hanging out; and as it groweth greater, it openeth the shell by degrees, till at length it is
all come foorth, and hangeth onely by the bill; in short space after it commeth to full
maturitie, and falleth into the sea, where it gathereth feathers, and groweth to a foule,
bigger then a Mallard, and lesser than a Goose; having blacke legs and bill or beake,
and feathers blacke and white, spotted in such maner as is our Magge-Pie, called in
some places a Pie-Annet, which the people of Lancashire call by no other name than a
tree goose; which place aforesaide, and all those parts adjoining, do so much abound
therewith, that one of the best is bought for three pence: for the truth heerof, if any
doubt, may it please them to repaire unto me, and I shall satisfie them by the testimonie
of good witnesses.</p></div>

<p>The woodcut illustrations with which the book abounds are
designed in a good artistic style, being frequently consulted and
adapted nowadays by artists engaged in floral design. In 1596, Gerard
seems to have propounded a scheme for the Company to keep a
garden for the cultivation and study of medicinal plants, and some
land belonging to the Company in East Smithfield was suggested
for this purpose, but not being thought a suitable spot, certain
members of the Court offered to contribute towards the purchase of a
garden elsewhere; in June, 1597, the subject was under consideration,
and again in November, 1602; but whether anything further was done
in the matter does not appear. The minutes in our books relating to
this business, are as <span class="nowrap">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">26th March, 1596. A motion was also made concerninge the Demisinge of
certen garden grounds at East Smithfield for the w<sup>ch</sup> M<sup>r</sup> ffettyplace, M<sup>r</sup> Lacock and John
Gerard were sevˀall Sutors. Yt was agreed that the same should be let for yerely rent at
the pleasures of the masters or governors and none of the said sutors obteyned any
graunte. But for as muche as John Gerard’s request was to have yt to make a garden of
yt for the ffurtherance of learning in the knowledge and practiqe of the nature and skill of
herbes, w<sup>ch</sup> was thought not a place ffytt for that pˀpose, but that a more convenient place
should be sought owte and dyvers of the Companie did offer to be contributors for the
buying of the same, and M<sup>r</sup> ffetiplace and M<sup>r</sup> Lacock are to be spoken w<sup>th</sup>all and thus to
be satisfied.</p>

<p>2nd November, 1602. This daye it is ordered that the Committes for M<sup>r</sup>
Gerrard’s garden shall this aft<sup>r</sup> noone meet at the hall to consider of the report for a
Garden for the said M<sup>r</sup> Gerrard.</p></div>

<p>In August, 1597, John Gerard was chosen Junior Warden
(George Baker, the Queen’s Serjeant-Surgeon being at the same time
elected Master), and in January following he was appointed one of
the Examiners of Surgeons. In 1604, there had been controversies
between Gerard and Christopher Frederick (Master 1609), which
on the 12th June were referred to a Committee of the Court for
settlement. “And if they no ende can make they are to make
report at the next Court of their pˀcedinges therein.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>26th September, 1605. This day M<sup>r</sup> Jerrard was discharged of the office of
second Warden and upper governo<sup>r</sup> of this Company uppon his suite &amp; entreatie for
certayne considerac͠ons. And is fyned for the said places at x<sup>li</sup> which he is pˀntlie to pay
to the pˀnte M<sup>rs</sup> or governours And is hereafter to take his place as though he had
served the place of upper Governo<sup>r</sup> any thinge to the contrarie notwithstandinge.</p></div>

<p>7th November, 1605. The above order was rescinded, but
shortly afterwards Mr. Gerard brought £10 into Court, and left it
with the Wardens, when it was ordered that the matter should be
further considered, and in the result the fine was accepted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>21st October, 1606. This daie John Gerrard was fyned at vj<sup>s</sup> viij<sup>d</sup> for abuseing
M<sup>r</sup> Peck and it is ordered that from henceforth they shall be freinds, and all
Controversyes betweene them are to cease.</p></div>

<p>20th July, 1607. Mr. Gerard was again appointed an Examiner
of Surgeons, and 17th August following elected Master.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth is reported to have entertained a high opinion
of Mr. Gerard’s attainments, and he was also patronised by her<span class="pagenum" title="544"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544"></a></span>
Minister, William Cecil, Lord Burleigh, whose garden he superintended
for twenty years. In the dedication of his Herbal to Lord Burleigh,
in speaking of the “care and studie” of herbs, he <span class="nowrap">says&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">Under your Lordship I have served, and that way imployed my principall studie,
and almost all my time now by the space of twenty yeeres. To the large and singular
furniture of this noble Iland, I have added from forren places all the varietie of herbes
and flowers that I might any way obtaine, I have laboured with the soile to make it fit
for the plants, and with the plants to make them to delight in the soile, that so they
might live and prosper under our climate, as in their native and proper countrie: what
my successe hath beene, and what my furniture is, I leave to the report of them that
have seene your Lordships gardens, and the little plot of my speciall care and husbandrie.</p></div>

<p>Among the numerous epistles, etc., laudatory of Gerard, prefixed
to the Herbal are some exceedingly quaint verses dedicated by
“Thomas <span class="nowrap">Thorney<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span> Master in Chirurgerie, to his learned friend and
loving brother in Art, M. John Gerard.” There is also an epistle by
“George Baker, one of hir Maiesties chiefe Chirurgions in ordinarie,
and M. of the Chirurgions of the Citie of London.” Besides his
garden in Holborn, Gerard seems also to have had one in the Strand
by Somerset House, and to have held the appointment of “Herbarist”
to James I, for among the Domestic State papers at the Record Office,
is a grant dated 10th October, 1603, by Anne, Queen of James I to
Sir Robert Cecil, Lord Cecil of Essingdon, of the Keepership of
Somerset House with all the orchards, walks, gardens, &amp;c., thereto
belonging “except and alwaies reserved to John Gerrard of London
Surgeon and herbarist to his Ma<sup>tie</sup> all that garden plott or peece of
ground w<sup>th</sup> all and singular pˀfittꝭ comodities and other the app̃tencꝭ

<p><span class="pagenum" title="545"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545"></a></span></p>

<p>In 1639 the Company purchased a copy of Gerard’s work for
the Library. “Paid for M<sup>r</sup> John Gerrardꝭ herball for the library
for Claspes &amp; settinge on the chaine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. xxv<sup>s</sup> vj<sup>d.</sup>”</p>

<p>John Gerard died in February, 1612, and was buried at
St. Andrew’s, Holborn, on the 18th of that month. There is a
fine portrait of Gerard facing page 1 of the Herbal, in which he
is represented holding a potato plant in his hand; below are the
arms of the Barber-Surgeons and his own coat, viz., quarterly 1st

<h3>SIR THOMAS BLUDDER.</h3>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> was the son of Sir Thomas Bludder, of Flanchford,
in the parish of Reigate (who died 1st November, 1618). He was
knighted at Whitehall, 22nd April, 1618, and married three times, his
third wife being Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Brett, of Rotherby,
Lancashire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<img src="images/img095.jpg" width="165" height="228" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">Martin Browne</span> was born about 1590,
probably in Lincolnshire; he was apprenticed
to Thomas Clemence, a surgeon free
of the Company, and on 13th July, 1613,
was admitted to the freedom. He seems to
have had an extensive practice, and in 1648
was living in Creed Lane. There are
numerous references to him in our Minutes,
from which may be gathered that he was a
man of great experience, and well able to
hold his own in some cases where his professional
skill had been called in question by
jealous brethren of the craft. He served as Warden in 1640 and 1645,
and was Master in 1653, when he presented the Company with a
loving cup (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_501">p.&nbsp;502</a>). He died 16th April, 1655, and in his
will dated 20th August, 1654, and proved 24th April, 1655, he
describes himself as of the parish of St. Gregory, “full of yeares,”
and requests to be buried in his parish church near his dead
children “which was partly under my owne pewe where now of late I
satt.” To the poor of that parish he leaves £10. To the poor of East
Tilbury 40<i>s.</i> To the poor of Louth, in Lincolnshire, £10. To his
cousin Richard Mason, of Leeyborne, Lincolnshire, £5, and to his son,
Richard Mason, testator’s apprentice, £5 and his case of silver
instruments, “with fower books of phisick and of Chirurgery namelie
Ambrose Parrey and Rondeletius and Aqua Sendens his mannuall<span class="pagenum" title="547"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547"></a></span>
operations and Tangaltius and others Authers all bound up in one
volumne.” He gives several legacies of money to cousins, nieces,
servants, and apprentices, makes his wife Margaret his executrix, and
leaves all his lands and houses in the counties of Essex and Lincoln and
the City of London to her for life, with remainder to his only child
Rebecca, the wife of Humphry Winch, Esquire. “To my cousen
Henery Barker all my Instruments of yron for Chirurgerie excepte my
Lancetts and incision knives. I likewise give [him] theise bookes
namely the workes of Hypocrates, Galen, Celsus, Paulus Agenta,

<h3>EDWARD ARRIS, <span class="smcap">Alderman</span>.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img096.jpg" width="165" height="233" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em">Few names are held in greater veneration at
Barbers’ Hall than that of Edward Arris.
His father, Jasper Arris, was apprenticed
to Thomas Burston or Burstowe, a Surgeon
and Master of the Company in 1576. Jasper
Arris (probably born 1560–2), was admitted
to the freedom, 3rd April, 1583, chosen a
Liveryman, 22nd January, 1606, an Assistant,
3rd August, 1614, served as Warden
in the years 1617 and 1622, and was
reported on 8th January, 1623, as then
recently deceased. There are few notices
of Jasper in our books, and one of them on 21st October, 1606, is
perhaps not much to his credit, as it records his fine for working on the
Sabbath day; from which we may gather that he was one of those who,<span class="pagenum" title="548"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"></a></span>
contrary to the Ordinances and the Statute, worked both as a Barber
and Surgeon,&mdash;a practice often winked at by the Governors.
His son Edward, was born in London in 1591, and was admitted
to the freedom by patrimony on 21st January, 1617, having learnt his
art with his father; he was admitted to the Livery 9th October, 1627,
and on 30th April, 1629, granted his diploma to practise Surgery. In
1632, he was chosen Steward, and the next year Master of the
Anatomy. On the 23rd April, 1640, he was elected an Assistant and
served the office of Warden in 1642. On 10th February, 1648, he was
appointed one of the Examiners of Surgeons, and elected Master of the
Company 1651. On 3rd July, 1663, Mr. Arris was nominated by the
Court of Aldermen, Alderman of the Ward of Bridge Without (<i>loco</i>
Richard Evans) and was sworn in on the 28th July following, but this
civic office was probably an uncongenial one to him, for he very shortly
afterwards applied to be discharged from it, and thereupon paid a fine
of £300 to the City.</p>

<p>In 1645 Mr. Arris founded an Anatomy Lecture, and with a
characteristic modesty endeavoured to conceal the founder’s name,
though his intention in this respect was necessarily frustrated when the
deed of settlement had to be drawn. This, the Arrisian Lecture, still
survives at the Royal College of Surgeons. (Particulars of the
foundation will be found on pp. 368, 369.) In 1649, when our plate
was sold, Mr. Arris re-purchased King Henry VIII’s cup, and “freely
gave it againe to this Company,” for which all Barber-Surgeons and
Barbers have ever after been profoundly grateful to him. He also,
in 1651, gave us four silver cups. Mr. Arris’ granddaughter,
Henrietta Maria Langford, seems to have got into straitened
circumstances, as on 5th August, 1718, we read “It is ordered that
Henrietta Maria Langford daughter of Robert Arris son of Alderman
Arris Members of this Company, shall be made free without charge, in
<span class="pagenum" title="549"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"></a></span>Gratitude to the Memory of Alderman Arris, in order that she may be
admitted one of the Company’s Pentioners.”</p>

<p>The Alderman died 28th May, 1676, at the good old age of
eighty-five and is buried in St. Sepulchre’s Church, where there is a
quaint tablet with this <span class="nowrap">inscription&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="tab">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By his Will, dated 20th May, 1676, he directs his body to be
buried in the grave of his father, mother and wife in St. Sepulchre’s,
and he bequeathed his property to his then only surviving son Thomas
Arris, M.D., M.P., and his children, and to the children of his deceased
son Robert. He gave five legacies of £400 each and some smaller
ones amongst his grandchildren and an annuity of £30 a year to
his grandson Robert. He also bequeathed messuages, lands, &amp;c.,
at Hatfield, two messuages in Well Yard, St. Bartholomew’s
the Less, a messuage near Pye Corner, ten acres of Copyhold land
in the manor of Bedwell near Hatfield and four freehold houses in the
parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden, to his son and grandchildren. “I
give Ten shillings a peece to soe many Antient men as I shall be yeares

<span class="pagenum" title="550"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550"></a></span>Tenn of the Company of Barber Chirurgeons and the rest of the
Parish of St. Sepulchres.” He also left £8 to the poor of St.
Sepulchre’s to be given to 160 poor at his burial; £5 to the poor
of St. Bartholomew the Less; £5 to Christ’s Hospital among 100
children to attend his burial; 20<i>s.</i> each to the two Beadles of the
Barber-Surgeons, and 5<i>s.</i> each to the four Beadles of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital; also £5 to Dr. Bell to preach a sermon at his burial.</p>

<h3>SIR JOHN FREDERICK.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img098.jpg" width="165" height="189" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">John Frederick</span> was a son of Christopher
Frederick, Barber-Surgeon. A minute of
the 9th June, 1595, states that “the said
Xpõfer ffrederick being a strainger borne
had his ffreedom geven him of the Cittie
of London by vertue of her Mat<sup>ies</sup> most
gracious Lrẽs to the Lord maior and
Corte of Aldrem̃e directed and was made
fre of this Companie and after chosen of
the lyvery and then one of Thassistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="551"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551"></a></span></p>

<p>Christopher Frederick was on more than one occasion at serious
variance with the Court, as also with some of its members, and a
resolution was passed, evidently with pointed allusion to him, viz., that
in future aliens should be ineligible for the Court. He was Serjeant-Surgeon
to James I, and probably to Elizabeth also; Master in 1609
and again in 1616. His son William was admitted to the freedom by
service 27th October, 1607. Christopher Frederick was buried 10th
October, 1623, in the church of St. Olave, Jewry, where also Mary, his
widow, was interred on 6th June, 1636. They had issue six sons and
six daughters.</p>

<p>John Frederick, the fourth son, was baptized 25th October, 1601,
and educated at Christ’s Hospital. On 17th July, 1632 he was
admitted to the freedom by patrimony, on the 13th November, 1635
elected to the Livery, and on 30th January, 1645 made an Assistant.
He was a successful merchant and resided in a large mansion on the
site of what is now Frederick’s Place, Old Jewry (which he rebuilt
after the Great Fire in 1666). This house was afterwards used as the
Excise Office, upon the removal of which to Broad Street, the building
was taken down and the present houses erected. He was elected
Alderman of Vintry September, 1653, and in 1660 removed to Coleman
Street Ward. He was Master of the Barber-Surgeons in 1654 and
again in 1658; he served as Sheriff, 1655–6, and was then knighted.
The Barber-Surgeons attended Sir John in their barge to Westminster
when he went to be sworn in as Sheriff, and ordered his portrait to be
painted at a cost of £15. This fine picture representing the Sheriff in
his robes and with a flowing wig, is preserved at Barbers’ Hall. In
1661 Sir John was translated to the Grocers’ Company to enable
him to take upon him the office of Lord Mayor, which he served
1661–2. The pageant performed at the expense of the Grocers<span class="pagenum" title="552"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a></span>
upon his accession to the Mayoralty was entitled “Londons
Tryumphs presented in several delightfull Scænes,” and was
composed by John Tatham; a copy of this very rare tract is
preserved in the Guildhall Library. Pepys, under date 29th
October, 1661, <span class="nowrap">writes&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">This day I put on my half cloth black stockings and my new coate of
the fashion, which pleases me well, and with my bever I was (after office was
done) ready to go to my Lord Mayor’s feast, as we are all invited; but the
Sir Williams were both loth to go, because of the crowd, and so none of us
went. My mind not pleased because I had proposed a great deal of pleasure
to myself this day at Guildhall. This Lord Mayor, it seems, brings up again the
custom of Lord Mayors going the day of their instalment to Paul’s and walking
round about the Crosse, and offering something at the Altar.</p></div>

<p>In 1662 Sir John was elected Master of the Grocers’ Company
and also President of Christ’s Hospital, which latter office he held
until 1683. In the Parliament of 1660 he represented Dartmouth;
on the 10th March, 1663, he was elected one of the Members for the
City and so continued until the dissolution in January, 1679. In
1674 he gave £100 towards rebuilding Barber-Surgeons’ Hall; he
also repaired and fitted up the Great Hall at Christ’s Hospital
at a cost of £5,000. In 1664 he bore the expense of bringing
the Conduit Water from Gray’s Inn Fields to the Hospital. In 1667
he gave £50 and twenty chaldrons of sea coal, and by his Will
bequeathed £500 to the Hospital. In 1654 he gave a handsome
silver loving cup and cover weighing about 38&nbsp;oz. to the
Barber-Surgeons; this cup is still used on festive occasions.
There is a portrait of Sir John at Christ’s Hospital, which
represents him as seated in an arm chair, in his civic robes,
with an open letter in his hand, on his head is a full bottomed<span class="pagenum" title="553"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553"></a></span>
wig and a black cap, he has white whiskers and a tuft of white
hair on his under lip.</p>

<p>In the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for November, 1769,
is a copy of a document prepared for Charles II, giving the
characters of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, which says of
Sir John Frederick <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">by reason of his age, he is apt to be ledd by others, especially by Sir John
Lawrence, a man of little dispatch, very readie to run into mistakes; he hates a souldier,
and cannot endure to see any of the King’s guards.</p></div>

<p>Sir John married Mary Rous by whom he had issue four sons
and nine daughters. Judith, his eldest daughter, married Sir Nathaniel
Herne (Alderman and Sheriff 1674 and Master of the Barber-Surgeons
1674), who, dying in August, 1679, she married secondly, Robert
Hooker, of Hatton Garden. Her Will, dated in 1688, was proved
30th June, 1691.</p>

<p>Sir John Frederick was buried in the Church of St. Olave
Jewry 19th March, 1685, where his widow was also interred 19th
December, 1689; she bequeathed £300 to Christ’s Hospital. His
eldest son Thomas was the father of John Frederick who was created a
baronet 10th June, 1723. Sir John gave marriage portions of £3,000
apiece to his daughters Judith and Elizabeth, who married respectively
Sir Nathaniel Herne and Sir Joseph Herne, and he covenanted to give
£2,000 apiece more either in his lifetime or by will; it seems that he
did this by will, which led to litigation, his relict (to whom he left about
£10,000) laying claim to some portion of these legacies by the custom
of London.</p>

<h3>SIR NATHANIEL HERNE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img099.jpg" width="165" height="232" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em">Sir <span class="smcap">Nathaniel Herne</span> was the son of
Nicholas and grandson of Richard Herne
(Alderman and Sheriff in 1618). He was
born in 1629 and in 1646 apprenticed at
Barber-Surgeons’ Hall to Sir John Frederick,
one of the merchant-princes of London at
that time. Herne was admitted to the freedom
on 7th May, 1655, and, like the typical
industrious apprentice, he married his master’s
daughter, Judith Frederick, by whom he had
(among others) a daughter Judith who
married William, second Earl of Jersey, and
thereby was one of the ancestors of the present Earl. Sir Nathaniel
Herne was a most successful merchant and amassed a large fortune.
In 1674 he was Sheriff of London (being knighted at Windsor on the
9th August) and Master of this Company. On the 11th April, 1676, he
was elected Alderman of the Ward of Billingsgate. He was sometime
M.P. for Dartmouth, and a Governor of the East India Company. He
died 16th August, 1679, being then fifty years of age and was buried
at St. Olave Jewry, where there is a monument to his memory, with his
arms impaling Frederick, and this <span class="nowrap">inscription:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>SIR JOHN LETHIEULLIER.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img101.jpg" width="165" height="191" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em">Sir <span class="smcap">John Lethieullier</span>, who was born in
1633, was descended from the Le Thieulliers,
an old Protestant family in the Low
Countries; his great grandfather John was
burnt at Valenciennes for his religion by the
infamous Duke D’Alva. His grandfather
John was a merchant at Cologne and died
there in 1593. His widow survived him
thirty-eight years and came over to England
in 1605 with her only son John, who was
born in 1591. In 1620 he was established as a Merchant in London,
but on the breaking out of the Civil Wars he went over to Amsterdam
and returned to England at the Restoration; he lived at Lewisham,
where he died on 2nd November, 1679, having married Jane, daughter
of John de la Fortre, of London, by whom he had five sons and three
daughters. His eldest son, Sir John Lethieullier, was apprenticed to
Sir John Frederick (Barber-Surgeon) and admitted to the freedom by
servitude 11th November, 1657. He served the office of Master in
1676, having been Sheriff of London in 1674. He was a successful
merchant and a rich man, having a great fortune by his wife Anne,
daughter of Sir William Hooker, who was Lord Mayor in 1673. Sir
John was a free brother of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of
England, and of the Society of Merchants of London Trading to the
Levant Seas and the East Indies. His third brother, Sir Christopher
Lethieullier was Sheriff of London, 1689, and died 1690. On the 20th
November, 1707, Sir John wrote to the Court asking to be relieved
from the office of an Assistant on account of his indisposition
and age (he was then 74), but the Court, out of a feeling of<span class="pagenum" title="557"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557"></a></span>
respect towards him, refused to accept his resignation, and ordered
that the Wardens should have a personal interview with him to
know his pleasure. This was done, and on the 15th January
following his resignation was accepted. Sir John, who resided at
Greenwich, died there on the 4th January, 1719, having had
two sons, John and William (both of whom were free of the
Company), and three daughters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<a href="images/img102large.jpg" title="Click to view a larger image"><img src="images/img102.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Sir John Lethieullier’s will, of prodigious length, is dated 6th
May, 1709, and he therein directs that he shall be buried in the vault

<h3>SIR HUMPHRY EDWIN.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img104.jpg" width="165" height="194" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em">Sir <span class="smcap">Humphry Edwin</span>, descended from an old
Herefordshire family, was born at Hereford
in 1642. He was the only son of William
Edwin (sometime Mayor of Hereford) by
his wife Anne Mansfield, and grandson of
William Edwin of the Field next Hereford.
One of his sisters (Mary) was married to
Sir Edward Dering. He married Elizabeth,
daughter of Samuel Sambrooke, a London
merchant, and a sister of Sir Jeremy Sambrooke;
by her he had four sons, born between 1671 and 1677, viz.,
Samuel, Humphry, Thomas and Charles.</p>

<p>On the 3rd February, 1679, he was admitted to our freedom;
on 11th October, 1687, he was sworn in Alderman of Tower Ward
on the direct appointment of James II; on the 18th November
following he was knighted at Whitehall, and a few weeks later
appointed Sheriff of Glamorganshire, in which county he had purchased
considerable estates. In 1688 Edwin was chosen Sheriff of London
and Master of the Barber-Surgeons. In 1689 he took official part in
the Proclamation of William and Mary in the City, and shortly after
was appointed a Commissioner of Excise with a salary of £1,000;
he was also an officer in the Honourable Artillery Company, and a
Colonel of the Trained Bands.</p>

<p>In 1691 Edwin was the victim of a malicious prosecution; he
was indicted for perjury, and a true bill found against him, but on
his trial was acquitted, Lord Chief Justice Holt not calling on him
to swear all his witnesses. Sir Humphry owned extensive property
near Westminster Hall, he also had a mansion at Kensington, and<span class="pagenum" title="561"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561"></a></span>
added to his Glamorganshire property the castle and lordship of
Ogmore. In 1697 his eldest son Samuel was married to Lady
Catharine Montagu, daughter of the Earl of Manchester, and the same
year Sir Humphry was elected Lord Mayor of London, having been
previously translated from the Barber-Surgeons to the Skinners’
Company. The customary mayoralty pageant was omitted, owing,
doubtless, to Edwin’s religious scruples, he being a Nonconformist. Soon
after his admission as Lord Mayor, he gave great offence by attending
Nonconformist worship at a conventicle on the afternoons of Sunday,
31st October and 7th November, in full civic state. A meeting of the
Court of Aldermen was held 9th November to consider a complaint
of the Swordbearer against the Lord Mayor, for compelling his
attendance on the occasion when the Lord Mayor was deserted by all
his officers except the Swordbearer, whom one of the chapel officials
had locked in a pew! According to the minute, the Court took notice
that the Lord Mayor had “for two Lords dayes past in the afternoones
gone to private meetings with the sword,” whereupon his Lordship
promised to forbear the practice for the future. Edwin’s action roused
all the bitterness of the High Church party and caused an angry
literary controversy in which Dr. Nicholls, James Peirce, Calamy and
Defoe joined, and in which the question of “occasional conformity” was
raised. Edwin had on his election received the Sacrament in accordance
with the rites of the Church of England, and his friend Defoe took
him very severely to task for this, charging him with having “played
bo-peep with God Almighty.”</p>

<p>On the 19th April, 1694, Sir Humphry Edwin was dismissed
from the Court of Assistants of our Company on account of his
continued non-attendance. He died 14th December, 1707, at his
country seat at Llanmihangel, intestate, administration being granted
to his son Charles on 19th February following. His widow died in<span class="pagenum" title="562"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562"></a></span>
London 22nd November, 1714. Besides the children already mentioned
he had four daughters and a fifth son John, from whom is descended
the present Earl of Crawford and Balcarres.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img106.jpg" width="165" height="233" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">Charles Bernard</span>, who was born about
1656, was a son of Samuel Bernard, D.D.,
of Croydon. On 16th August, 1670 (his
father being then dead), he was apprenticed
to Henry Boone, Surgeon, for seven years,
and on 4th December, 1677, was admitted
to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons; on
25th October, 1697, he was chosen an
Assistant, and on 8th November, 1700,
an Examiner of Surgeons in the place of
Thomas Lichfield. In 1702 he was appointed
Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen Anne, and in
1703 he was Master of the Company. One of his brothers, Dr. Francis
Bernard, was physician to James II, and he had another brother,
Dr. William Bernard. Charles Bernard died at Lord Weymouth’s
house, Long Leate, Wilts, on 9th October, 1710, and shortly afterwards
the Company caused his portrait to be painted. There is a Latin
inscription below it which is highly eulogistic of Bernard, the following
being a <span class="nowrap">translation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="mt-05em">This portrait of Charles Bernard Esquire, Royal Surgeon in Chief, most learned
in Greek and Latin letters, most experienced, candid and upright in his profession,
enjoying the greatest favour with the Most Serene Queen Anne, the greatest fame among<span class="pagenum" title="564"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564"></a></span>
the laity, the greatest authority among his fellows, the greatest esteem among all, in
consideration of the remission by the same Most Serene Queen at his prayer of a heavy
sum of nearly one thousand pounds in which this Company was bound to the Royal
Exchequer, and in consideration of his advancement of Surgical science, his assertion and
augmentation of its dignity, and other brilliant services to the Surgeons, the Company
caused this portrait to be painted after his death 1711.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Bernard possessed a valuable library containing a curious
collection of the best authors in Physic, Philology, Antiquities, &amp;c.,
together with many ancient manuscripts, all of which were sold by
Auction in March, 1711, at the Black Boy Coffee House in Ave Maria
Lane. Swift in his Journal to Stella, March 19th, says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I went to-day to see poor Charles Bernard’s books, and I itch to lay out nine or
ten pounds for some fine Editions of fine authors *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I walked to-day into the
City, and went to see the auction of poor Charles Bernard’s books. They were in the
middle of Physic books, so I bought none, and they are so dear I believe I shall buy none.</p></div>

<p>A catalogue of these books is in the Sloane collection (1770).</p>

<p>In Nichols’ Literary Anecdotes is a story of Mr. Edward
Thwaites, M.A., Fellow of Queen’s College, Oxford, which
characteristically introduces Mr. Bernard.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernard’s daughter Elizabeth was married to Ambrose
Dickins, Esquire (who was Master in 1629 and Serjeant-Surgeon).</p>

<p>By his Will, dated 7th November, 1707, he bequeathed to his
wife Susan, £500 and his houses in Broad Street, Pissing Alley and
Milk Street. To his daughter Susan £1,000, and other bequests to his
daughters Elizabeth and Mary, his son Charles and his sister Jane. He
desires to be buried privately and late at night, makes his children
residuary legatees and appoints his brother, Dr. William Bernard and
his kinsman, Thomas Sisson, executors. By a codicil 3rd October,<span class="pagenum" title="565"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"></a></span>
1710, he revokes the appointment of executors and makes his son,
Henry Bernard, and Charles Bernard (Clerk of the Barber-Surgeons)
his executors with £100 each.</p>

not recorded. He was elected a Director
of the French Protestant Hospital (La
Providence) 2nd January, 1723. He was
also a Fellow of the Royal Society and
Serjeant-Surgeon to George II. On 7th
May, 1728, he was admitted to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons,<span class="pagenum" title="566"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566"></a></span>
examined and approved touching his skill in surgery, admitted to fine

Assistants. It was ordered on the same day “in regard to the dignity
of their offices” that Mr. Serjeant Dickins and Mr. Serjeant Amyand
should hereafter take precedence next after the Governors for the time
being. Mr. Amyand served as Warden in 1729 and 1730 and was
Master of the Company in 1731. He was Surgeon to St. George’s
Hospital 1733–1738. By his wife, Mary Rabache, he had three sons
and six daughters. The eldest son Claudius was Under-Secretary of
State in 1750 and an M.P.; he married Frances widow of George, 6th
Earl of Northampton. The second son George who was also an M.P.

1764, created a baronet. The third son Thomas was in holy orders.
The eldest daughter Anne married John Porter, M.P., Alderman and
Sheriff of London; another daughter, Mary Catherine married Sir
Richard Adams, Recorder of London and a Baron of the Exchequer;
and the youngest daughter Judith, was married to the Rev. Thos.
Ashton, D.D., Rector of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate.</p>

<p>Sir George Amyand (son of Claudius) was succeeded by his
eldest son, Sir George Cornewall, Bart., M.P., who on his marriage with
Catherine daughter and heiress of Velters Cornewall, M.P., assumed

baronet of that name. Sir George Amyand’s second son John Amyand,
M.P., died in 1780 unmarried; his daughter Anna Maria married
Gilbert, Earl of Minto, and another daughter, Harriet Mary, married
James, Earl of Malmesbury.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM CHESELDEN, F.R.S.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/img110.jpg" width="165" height="191" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">This</span> eminent Surgeon was the son of George
Cheselden, and born 19th October, 1688, at
Somerby, near Burrow-on-the-Hill, Leicestershire.
He was at an early age studying
anatomy with William Cowper, the celebrated
anatomist, but appears to have left him when
fifteen years old, for on the 7th December,
1703, he was bound apprentice for seven
years to James Ferne, the Surgeon to St.
Thomas’ Hospital, under which distinguished
man he made rapid advance in his profession. On 5th December, 1710,
he was admitted to the freedom and livery of the Barber-Surgeons,
on the 29th January following he had a full certificate to practise
as a Surgeon, and he then (being but twenty-two years of age) began
his lectures on anatomy, and the following year was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>By a minute in our books of 25th March, 1714, it seems that
Mr. Cheselden had often procured the bodies of malefactors and
privately dissected them at his own house, and that at times when
lectures and dissections were proceeding at the Hall, whereby the
attendance at the Hall was diminished, and moreover contrary to the
express laws of the Company; whereupon he was summoned before
the Court and reproved, when he promised not to offend again in
like manner. A less influential man would probably have been fined.</p>

<p>In 1719 he was elected Surgeon to St. Thomas’ Hospital,
where he highly distinguished himself in his operations for the stone.
He was also consulting Surgeon to St. George’s and the Westminster<span class="pagenum" title="569"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"></a></span>
Infirmary. In 1727 he was appointed principal Surgeon to Queen
Caroline, and ten years later was chosen Head Surgeon to Chelsea
Hospital, which post he held till his death. He married Miss Deborah
Knight of London, by whom he had an only daughter. His practice
was both extensive and lucrative, and his works on Surgery are
numerous, besides which he was a frequent contributor to the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Mr. Cheselden
died at Bath on the 10th April, 1752.</p>

<p>Dr. J.&nbsp;F. Payne says that he will always be regarded as, beyond
dispute, one of the greatest of British surgeons, being one of the
most brilliant operators whose achievements are upon record; he was
a keen patron of athletic sports, especially boxing; his disposition
was gay and genial, he was fond of society, and evidently popular,
while to his patients he was always kind and tender-hearted.</p>

<p>On the separation of the Surgeons from the Barbers in 1745,
Mr. Cheselden was named in the Act of Parliament one of the Wardens
of the new Company of Surgeons, he having been Junior Warden
of the Barber-Surgeons that year. His will is a remarkable specimen
of brevity and absence of <span class="nowrap">formality:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ti0em"><span class="smcap">Ambrose Dickins</span> (sometimes spelt Dickens)
was the son of George Dickins of Riplington,
in East Meon, Hampshire, gentleman,
and was probably born about 1687. On
the 17th February, 1702, he was apprenticed
to Serjeant-Surgeon Charles Bernard for
seven years, and on the 16th February,
1709, he was admitted to the Freedom
and Livery of the Barber-Surgeons, when
he was residing in James Street, Covent
Garden. He married (before the 24th
March, 1709) Elizabeth, daughter of Charles
Bernard. On December 20th, 1721, he was elected Surgeon to
Westminster Hospital. His old master, Charles Bernard, died in
October, 1710, and it seems that Dickins succeeded him when quite
a young man in the important office of Serjeant-Surgeon. In 1728
he was Warden of the Barber-Surgeons, and in 1729 Master of the
Company. He was Surgeon to St. George’s Hospital 1733–38. On
the separation of the Surgeons from the Barbers in 1745, Mr. Dickins
became an Assistant of the Surgeons’ Company and an Examiner of
Surgeons. He probably died in 1747, as on 7th September in that
year Mr. Cæsar Hawkins was appointed Serjeant-Surgeon in his place.</p>

<p>Dr. John Douglas, Bishop of Salisbury, in “The Criterion,”
introduces Mr. Dickins’ name in an interesting paragraph. Dr.
Douglas was a firm believer in the efficacy of the Royal touch for the
King’s evil, and he gives some curious particulars of Mr. Dickins’
experience in this matter which are well worth referring to.</p>

inventor of the cutting gorget, and a remarkably
dexterous operator.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1st July, 1735. M<sup>r</sup> Cæsar Hawkins Surgeon in
Bloomsbury who had lived several years with his father
a Surgeon in the Country and afterwards with M<sup>r</sup> Ranby
a Foreign Brother of the Company seven years, but not bound an Apprentice at the Hall,
was in consideration thereof, admitted into the freedom of the Company for six pounds
six shillings which he paid down and was sworne. At the same time the said M<sup>r</sup> Cæsar
Hawkins was examined touching his skill in Surgery his answers were approved of and he
was ordered the Diploma under the hands of the Governors and the seal of the Company
testifying his skill and impowering him to practice.</p></div>

<p>19th August, 1736. Mr. Hawkins was admitted to the Livery,
and the same day was chosen a Demonstrator of Anatomy, being then
but twenty-five years of age.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>18th August, 1737. M<sup>r</sup> Cæsar Hawkins one of the Demonstrators of Anatomy
attended at this Court and surrendered the said office and after returning this Court his
thanks for the honor they had done him to choose him one of their Demonstrators
acquainted them that he being appointed Surgeon to his Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales, and also Surgeon to one of the troops of Guards, could not perform the office of a
Demonstrator and therefore the Court accepted of such surrender.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Hawkins, in addition to his other appointments, was
Surgeon to St. George’s Hospital, 1735–1774, and Serjeant-Surgeon to
George III, to which latter office he was appointed 7th September, 1747.
By his practice as a phlebotomist alone he is said to have made £1,000<span class="pagenum" title="572"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"></a></span>
a year, it then being the custom for people to be bled at the spring and
fall of the year.</p>

<p>His family have been Surgeons for some generations, and have
held distinguished office, his brother Pennell Hawkins, his son Charles,
and his grandson Cæsar Henry, having all been Serjeant-Surgeons.
On the 25th July, 1778, Mr. Hawkins was created a Baronet; he
died 13th February, 1786. A portrait of him, by Hogarth, is in the
Hall of the Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

<h3><a id="APPENDIX_E"></a>APPENDIX E. (<i>See page <a href="#Page_157">157</a>.</i>)</h3>

<h4>THE CASE OF THE BARBERS OF LONDON.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Barbers</i> of <i>London</i> were a <i>Fraternity</i> before the Time of <i>Edward the Second</i>,
and by Letters-Patent of <i>Edward the Fourth</i> were made a <i>Body Corporate</i>, and invested
with several Powers and Privileges. In the 32d Year of <i>Henry the Eighth</i>, the <i>publick</i>
Policy thought proper to <i>unite</i> them with another Company (not then <i>incorporated</i>) called
the <i>Surgeons</i> of <i>London</i>, in order, (as is most probable) to <i>transfer</i> those Powers and
Privileges to the <i>latter</i>, without directly appearing to <i>wrest</i> them from the <i>former</i> to whom
they had been <i>originally</i> granted.</p>

<p>The <i>Coalition</i> of the two Companies having now subsisted above <i>Two Hundred
Years</i>, the <i>Barbers</i> are surpris’d to find an <i>Attempt</i> made by the <i>Surgeons</i> to <i>dissolve</i> it, by
Authority of <i>Parliament</i>, without their Participation or Consent.</p>

<p>The <i>principal Reasons</i> assigned by the <i>Surgeons</i>, in their printed Case, to induce
the legislature to the <i>extraordinary</i> Act of Power, are,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That the <i>Barbers</i>, in the Time of <i>Henry the Eighth</i>, were all <i>Surgeons</i>, and
that the Parliament, by <i>uniting</i> them with others of <i>superior</i> Abilities, intended <i>their</i>
Improvement in <i>that</i> Profession; but that they having, long since, <i>ceased</i> to intermeddle
with any Branch of <i>Surgery</i>, this <i>Intent</i> of the Act is frustrated, and the laudable <i>Purpose</i>
of the <i>Union</i> at an end.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That by this <i>Alteration</i> of the Circumstances of things, the Junction of
the two Companies (how advantageous soever in <i>former</i> Times) is <i>now</i> become highly
<i>inconvenient</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, That the <i>Surgeons</i> if <i>distinctly</i> incorporated, would be encouraged to
<i>meet</i> and <i>communicate</i> to one another their Experiments and Successes.</p>

<p>And <i>Fourthly</i>, That the like Separation has taken place at <i>Paris</i>, <i>Edinburgh</i>,
and <i>Glascow</i>.</p>

<p>BUT the <i>first</i> of these <i>Reasons</i> is grounded on a <i>Mistake</i> in point of <i>Fact</i>; for
tho’ it be <i>true</i> that the <i>Barbers</i> were <i>all originally Surgeons</i>, and incorporated <i>as such</i>, yet
long <i>before</i> the Union in question, <i>most</i> of them had <i>quitted</i> the <i>actual Exercise</i> of that
Profession, and the <i>Right</i> itself of exercising it <i>in virtue</i> of their Charter, had been <i>taken<span class="pagenum" title="595"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595"></a></span>
away</i>&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> by Parliament: And tho’ in the <i>Preamble</i> of the uniting Act, <i>both</i> Companies are
stiled <i>Surgeons</i>, yet from the <i>Enacting</i>&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> Part (which expresly <i>restrains</i> the <i>Barbers</i> from
occupying any part of <i>Surgery</i>, except <i>Tooth-drawing</i>) it is evident the <i>Legislature</i> did not
consider them as <i>real</i> Surgeons, nor could intend their <i>Improvement</i> in a Science they
were <i>forbid</i> to <i>practise</i>, so that the Circumstances of Things are <i>not</i> altered from what they
<i>then</i> were, or from what they manifestly were <i>designed</i> to be; and therefore the <i>Barbers</i>
having no Relation to the <i>Surgeons</i>, or their Art (as it was <i>then</i> deemed no <i>Objection</i> to
their <i>Union</i>) cannot <i>now</i>, with any Propriety, be insisted on as a <i>Reason</i> for their
<i>Separation</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>Inconveniences</i> complained of, as the Charge is <i>general</i>, this
<i>general</i> Answer only can be given, That the <i>Barbers</i> have always, with the greatest
Deference, <i>submitted</i> to the <i>Surgeons</i> in all Matters <i>peculiar</i> to them, and chearfully
contributed, out of their <i>common</i> Stock, towards every Expence which <i>they</i> have declared
necessary for the Honour or Advancement of <i>their</i> Profession. And since <i>none</i> of these
Inconveniences have been of Consequence enough to deserve being <i>particularly</i> pointed
out, we may venture to pronounce them <i>inconsiderable</i>, and unworthy the Attention and
Redress of <i>Parliament</i>; and the rather, as <i>all</i> of them put together, have not prevented
the <i>Surgeons</i> of <i>London</i> from carrying the Improvement of their Art, both in Speculation
and Practice, to a greater Height than has been done in any other Place or Nation.</p>

<p>That the frequent Meetings of ingenious Men, and their free Communications
on the Subject of their Profession, may tend <i>to the Benefit of Mankind in general, and to
the Honour of their Country in particular</i>, is not denied: But surely the Constitution of
the <i>united</i> Company is no obstacle to these laudable Purposes. The <i>Barbers</i> have for
many Years, at their Monthly Courts, submitted to <i>withdraw</i> at a stated Hour, and
<i>resigned</i> the Parlour to the Surgeons: And if this <i>Condescension</i> is not supposed to afford
them <i>sufficient</i> Time for Conversation on these <i>particular</i> Days, nothing <i>hinders</i> them
from holding <i>seperate</i> Assemblies at the Hall almost <i>every</i> other Day in the Year.</p>

<p>As to what is said to have been done at <i>Paris</i>, <i>Edinburgh</i>, and <i>Glascow</i>, no
<i>particular</i> answer can be given, unless it appeared by what <i>Means</i>, for what <i>Reasons</i>, and
upon what <i>Terms</i> the <i>Separations</i> in those Places were brought about. In <i>London</i> there
are but two Instances of Separations of Companies, <i>viz.</i> that of the <i>Feltmakers</i> from the
<i>Haberdashers</i> in 1604, and that of the <i>Apothecaries</i> from the <i>Grocers</i> in 1617; but both<span class="pagenum" title="596"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596"></a></span>
these were effected by <i>mutual</i> Consent, without the Intervention of <i>Parliament</i>; and it
may be proper to observe, that the Feltmakers miscarried in a former Application for an
exclusive Charter in 1576 for <i>want</i> of the Haberdashers Consent.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, therefore, the <i>Barbers</i> humbly hope the forgoing Reasons will
be deemed <i>insufficient</i> to induce the <i>Legislature</i> to destroy an <i>Union</i> they <i>themselves</i>
thought proper to <i>form</i>, an Union which two hundred Years Existence has rendred
<i>venerable</i>, and which, by the <i>Improvements</i> above-mentioned, appears to have answered all
the <i>Purposes</i> for which it was established.</p>

<p>But if for <i>other</i> Reasons (which the <i>Surgeons</i> say <i>may</i> be given) the Parliament
shall be inclined to favour them in <i>this part</i> of their request; the <i>Barbers</i>, from the
scrupulous Regard and Tenderness which that <i>August Assembly</i> has always shewn for
<i>private Property</i>, cannot but hope they shall be <i>continued</i> in the Enjoyment of <i>all</i> their
present Possessions, without any <i>Division</i> whatsoever, and that, for the following
Reasons:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, Because most of the <i>united</i> Company’s Lands and Tenements, (particularly
the Site of their <i>Hall, Parlour, &amp;c.</i>) originally belonged to <i>them</i>, and by the uniting <span class="nowrap">Act<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></span>
seem with great Justice to have been intended to remain to their <i>sole</i> and <i>separate</i> Use,
tho’ in fact the <i>Surgeons</i> have hitherto been <i>indulged</i> in the <i>equal</i> Enjoyment of them with
the <i>Barbers</i>.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Because the <i>Surgeons Share</i> of what may have been acquired <i>since</i> the
Union, will scarce be an <i>adequate</i> Recompence to the <i>Barbers</i> for the above <i>Indulgence</i>,
much less for the unmerited <i>Loss</i> of a Brotherhood now so <i>honourable</i> and <i>advantageous</i>
to them.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Because the Expenses of the <i>Barbers</i> when <i>distinctly</i> incorporated, can
fall but very little, if any thing, short of those of the <i>united</i> Company, so that a Reduction
of <i>Income</i> must subject them to very great Difficulties, which (considering that <i>they</i> neither
desire, nor have given the <i>Surgeons</i> just Cause to desire a Separation) would be extremely
hard and unreasonable.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, Because the present <i>flourishing</i> Condition of the <i>Surgeons</i>, (the only <i>real</i>
Alteration in the Circumstances of Things) will sufficiently enable them to support the
Dignity of their <i>new</i> and <i>favourite</i> Institution with becoming <i>Splendor</i>, without distressing
their <i>less happy</i> Brethren the <i>Barbers</i>.</p>

<p>The reader will find it convenient to observe the general arrangement of this Index
before using it, several references being grouped under distinctive or separate headings.</p>

<p>The details of various insignificant items (<i>e.g.</i>, many of the Wardens’ payments
pp. 379–422, and similar matter), together with the Biographical Notices and Appendices
(which speak for themselves), have not been indexed. To have given a reference to <i>every</i>
sentence would have <i>materially</i> increased the bulk of the volume without a corresponding
advantage, but every endeavour has been made to include whatever is practical or useful.</p>
